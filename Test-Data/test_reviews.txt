UR139733245	Stayed five nights in August. Room and bathroom ok for size; outlook internal courtyard. Aircon efficient but a bit noisy. Wi fi and access to various TV channels appreciated by youngest. Think most features have been cited already-lift on the small side (nice cool stairs if you didn't mind) and breakfast fair enough. Staff helpful and efficient in meeting requests (early calls/taxis) or queries about room. (Roomsafe uses and can eat euros.) With some staff it helped to speak a little Spanish as their English was limited and in one case non existent though he was usually working with an English speaker. Good location and only heard a distant sound from the street on the Saturday night. One or two guests more noisy coming and going but that's standard.
UR136935383	This is the second time we're stayed at this hotel. The staff are very helpful, the rooms are clean and quiet. Unlike some of the less expensive hotels, they have elevators so you don't have to carry luggage up staircases. The breakfast was quite good, with lots of choices- fruit, cereals, bread, cheese, boiled egss, hot filled spanish pastry things (sorry, I don't know what they were called) and cold pastries.
UR134517094	Like the other reviews on this hotel, the location cannot be faulted. It is right in the centre of Madrid and you can walk everywhere from here. Rooms are fine for all it's used for. Smallish but clean and tidy. There's air con in the room and a power shower. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and spoke perfect English. Antonio recommended a great restaurant, very helpful! Would stay at this hotel again without hesitation, great value for money.
UR133733645	Agree with all the other reviews. Location is amazing on this hotel Excellent location for touring Madrid, the hotel is situated just of the main street (Gran Via) so everything is within walking distance. Breakfast was average and good because it was free i wouldnt pay for it if i had too. Paid 35 euros to get there and 40 euros back to the airport. Shuttle time wasn't good for our outbound early flight. Room was very small but was decent enough. Airfield dint work on my iPhone but did work on my iPad and on my wife's iPhone. Air con worked well and the rooms were very clean. Overall would return to this hotel based on the location and price
UR131629728	We stayed in the los condes for 3 nights in early June 2012. Excellent location for touring Madrid, the hotel is situated just of the main street (Gran Via) so everything is within walking distance. Coming out of the hotel and walking down to the main street if you turn right within 15 mins you reach the Royal palace and if you turn left within 5 mins you are in the main shopping area. Breakfast was very nice and what you would expect from a small Spanish hotel. There are 2 lifts in the hotel one to the right of reception and on to the left and we had no problems with ether of them. The staff were excellent and very helpful, taxi from the hotel to the airport cost us €43 euros. There is an airport shuttle but this does not start until 6:30am so if you are leaving early they will arrange a taxi for you .Wi-Fi is throughout the hotel however is can be a little temperamental from your room (we were on the 5th floor) in the public areas was fine! Air con worked well and the rooms were very clean. We can recommend a little tapas bar situated in the centre “la Carboneria” , it’s at the top of the Pasadizo De San Gines. The food and staff were fantastic .
UR131161058	I stayed at this hotel over a weekend and wanted to cover the essentials of Madrid. It is just off Gran Via but in a quiet side street so no trouble with noise from outside. Air-con is a bit on the loud side but essential in the heat. Lift needs to be replaced/upgraded. Did not have breakfast here but chose to go out on to Gran Via and pick up something instead. Staff speak competent English and are helpful.
UR130661401	The big plus about this hotel is its location. From this hotel you can walk to all the major attractions and streets. But it's also near a metro stop if you don't want to walk. The rooms in the hotel are OK. Clean and not too small. The piping in the bathroom made funny sounds though every time you flushed the toilet. The breakfast was really nice. Croissants, chocolate croissants, yoghurt, cereal, bread, cheese, meat, jams. Good coffee and some OK fruit juices. The staff in this hotel were really friendly. Frontdesk spoke English, breakfast staff only Spanish, but they were really nice. I would recommend this hotel, because it's quite a good price for what you get.
UR129692882	Spent 3 nights in Madrid and overall the hotel was fine. Good points: Excellent location - walking distance to all major attractions - the Palace, Plaza Major, Prado, Retiro Park etc Very good free tea and coffee service - they bring this to your room within minutes of ordering - a real bonus first thing in the morning. Rooms were clean and shower very powerful. 5 mins walk to the Cafe Chinitas where you can see some great Flamenco dancing. Bad points: Rooms on the small side and beds very hard. Be careful - if you ask for a quiet room they put you in one with a tiny window onto a very small courtyard. No aircon until July/August so to get air in the room you have to open the window and put up with a bit of noise - to be expected in central Madrid. (only really a problem on a Saturday night). No UK channel on the TV. Overall I wouldn't go back - it was clean and friendly but really a B & B - round the corner is the Hotel Cason del Tormes which is probably a bit cheaper and better value for money with a more attractive bar and restaurant area, and larger rooms.
UR128001714	Good location: we walked to many major sites from this location as well as good dining options. The price was reasonable but the tradeoff was some street noise on Friday and Saturday nights, hard mattresses, and limited amenities. The room was clean. The staff was helpful and pleasant, especially the breakfast server.
UR127992472	I stayed at Los Condes for 6 nights on business in March 2012. I got a single room on the 1st floor, the room was tiny, but adequately laid out. It faced a shaft in the building and was very dark- the window opening into a concrete wall. The bed was a decent size but was incredibly uncomfortable- as was the pillow- and after the trip my back was shot to heck. I could constantly hear water sloshing and think it may have been placed next to the hotel laundry- in any case it was noisy at all hours. My only security concern was that there was no door chain or deadbolt on the inside of the door. Staff was friendly and helpful.
UR127488826	BAD My Reception wasn't that great. I didn’t feel quite welcome bath tub utterly small! I could barely turn around. There was a sign that said save water and shower instead of taking a bath. I couldn’t do either. Either the shower curtain would stick to me or I'd get bruised by the rod on the tub. No extra soap, just 1 small bar. It was very hot and there was no fan available. All controlled by central heating. Wen its 25 degress outside, the hotel considered it “winter.” Only 1 power outlet in the room and its socket was loose. Had to use Room service for hot water and milk. I would have preferred some machine in the room, so that I wouldn’t have to call every time. the wireless was HORRIBLE! I had to go to the reception twice to have it set up. Someone was supposed to get back to me about an Upgrade. No one did. No wakeup call on day 1 (mar 25) No tissue replacement There was residual music playing for 3 nights. I had to call the receptionist everytime. There was construction till 9 pm mar 28. There was smell of paint and thinner, plus the constant noise of drilling and metal cutting. The noise started again at 830am On mar 29. Paint smell started on mar29 around 6pm. It was horrible. I had to open my room door to let some air in. I actually felt dizzy after a while because of the fumes. Horrible shower head. GOOD The room was very small but well organized. The location was GREAT! the only redeeming feature of the hotel.
UR125068723	I actually travelled to Spain in Sept 2010 but never got around to writing the hotel reviews.So anyway, here's a belated review. The hotel is located just off a side-street off Gran Via - watch out for the signage for the name of the road. We travelled as a group of four - 2 young adults and 2 seniors and stayed on the first floor for one night.The two rooms were booked and prepaid via the Best Western website.There is a small lift which was useful for heavy luggages and tourists who have walking around the whole day! The rooms and bathroom were cosy, clean and has all the basic necessities. The staff at the counter was helpful and friendly.Within walking distance to the Metro station and main Railway Station. My mother, who is a fussy budget traveller, was happy with the rooms and amenities so I highly recommend it to people travelling with their parents.
UR123825117	Chose this hotel for a weeks intense sightseeing in Madrid, based on its central location and easy walking access to nearly all of the main "tourist" sights and of course price. An added bonus was that it is only 2 stops on the metro from the airport (return trip 5€ - a steal). On this trip the room was not overly important as it was only a place to crash and wash!! On reflection the hotel provided everything we needed and I would almost certainly return. The location off of the Grand Via was excellent and we could reach all of the key sights/museums/art galleries/ etc, easily by foot. The breakfasts were very good (continental) but plenty of it. The room was clean and a tad utilitarian. The twin beds were on the hard side, there was no AC - just a roof fan and the toilet area was very small, but clean. Still as I said it was only a place to crash! There was a lot going on in the area and we found lots of small bars. Being in the city there was some outside noise - BUT - hey you are in the middle of a city after all. It was not a problem. The staff were helpful and full of advice when asked for information on the City.
UR122941603	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in January 2012. The purpose of our visit was to go to watch the football, my husband is a great fan of Real Madrid. The hotel is the perfect location to visit the Bernabeu Stadium, only 4 stops on the tube and no need to change - perfect!. It is also only 5-10 mins walk to Puerta del Sol (the centre of the city) where everything goes on. The hotel is very clean and basic, just what you need. You dont spend time in your hotel room when you go to Madrid, there is soo much to see. The hotel is located just off Gran Via on a side street so no noise from the main road. For those of you that like the english fast foods, there is a KFC on the corner and McDonalds 2 doors away from that. We did not have breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment on this. The rooms with double beds rather than twin beds are much smaller and do not have a bidet in the bathroom. However, we did not spend much time in the hotel, so it didnt really matter. The beds are very hard, but we did so much walking and were so tired we could have slept on a washing line! The towels are old and need to be updated but they do the job, and dependant upon what room you have, the shower can have a mind of its own! It sounds like I am moaning a lot, I am not, just trying to make you aware of what its all about. We visited the Museo Del Prado on Saturday only to find out later on that it was free on Sunday mornings! I assume you will have to get there early though. We already looking to go back to this hotel, its cheap, clean, basic but has a perfect location and everything you need on a visit to Madrid.
UR116870324	Room of a very good size (comparing to 3 star hotel in London), nicely furnished - nothing fancy but really nice. Quiet (as much as possible in the middle of a city living at night). Bathroom - very good, all what you need was provided. All was very, very clean (didn't see such a clean hotel room for long time). The staff was very nice, smiling and helpful. Location - perfect - 10 minutes walk (max) to the Plaza Major. Walk back to the hotel at 2 am at night in July was safe (crowds on the streets as at noon in London) - hotel is just off one of main streets in the center of Madrid. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel - dining area looked ok but we preferred coffee and sandwiches either in the The Mercado de San Miquel (delicious) or in the bakery Le Pain Quotidien just nearby the hotel (http://www.lepainquotidien.com/)
UR113925230	All that you could want from a reasonably priced central city hotel, The room was not special, but very adequate and clean; bathrooms were compact but clean and functional. The staff were very helpful and could provide answers to my questions, from where could I get a power adapter (the answer being that I could borrow one from the hotel), to directions, trains, tubes, etc. We decided not to have the breakfast option thinking that we could buy it on the street for better value, but we were wrong. Wifi in the room worked well. I'd go back there again.
UR102183144	this hotel could not have been any better for the purpose of our stay.It was in a great location,comfortable,clean and warm with very friendly staff.Thankyou again best western you never let us down.
UR99566940	Basic Best Western style small hotel on a very nice location, in the center! Rooms are a bit small, but didnt bother us since we were out most of the time. Minibar ok, bathroom ok and clean. TV but not many English channels. Good breakfast, free tea/coffee all day. No kettles in the rooms, as mentioned at booking.com. Free wifi, worked well. The reception staff was bit reserved, but polite.
UR89077613	Room was clean. It was small but if you are out most of the day then this should not bother you. Bathroom was a good size and also clean. Didn't try breakfast, you can walk to Gran via and there are several places where you can get something to eat. Location is great, within less than a block to Gran Via. Double Decker tourist bus stops on the Gran Via. Easy access to transportation, metro stops close by. You can easily walk to Puerta del Sol and other locations. Just make sure you wear comfortable shoes. The hotel is located in a street with no traffic. On that same street you may find that at night a few people may hang around, sitting on the ground, perhaps drugged. We never had any trouble, they didn't seem to be bothered about anyone walking by. As you enter the hotel you'll find a few stairs about less than 10 to walk down to the reception area. This is the only part that is not easy for those with strollers or with difficulty with walking. There is an elevator that goes up to the rooms. Staff was generally friendly, a few here or there which were too serious. I read in other comments that people were rude and didn't speak English. The thing is that you have to realize that Spanish people generally don't speak English. So I suggest you learn a few basic words and accept it and enjoy your stay. I found that the people in Madrid were short with their answers, kind of abrupt, didn't smile , however they were helpful when needed. Just don't let it ruin your holiday.
UR87571163	We are a family with two very young children (2 & 1 year old) and stayed there from the 8th of Novemeber untill the 13th. "Los Condes" is an average hotel in a very good location. Just some steps away is the Callao Metro station and the start of the pedestrial road to the Puerto del Dol. We have stayed in much bigger rooms, but also in smaller ones. Room size is average. When we arrived the room was ready for us with the baby cot in the room. Unfortunately, there was no chance for second baby cot, but we can understand it. Allmost all hotels are providing just 1 per room. The big problem was that we had to walk down 8 steps to entry the hotel without ramp!!! I think this is very bad for a centrally located hotel in Madrid. Therei s space to built a ramp but... there is not any ramp. So we had to carry on the strollers with the babies and walk down the steps. Hotel has a small problem with it's soundproof. Allthought the street is quiet, there are much voices coming from outside at night. Not a big problem for us, but it would be problem for someone else. Finally, a little smell in the bathroom/toilet was not a big problem.
UR86067739	Great location, great price but oh so small. 8x10 for a single accomodation. Bed very hard and the WIFI was irregular and unreliable. arrived around 10:30 am and had to wait until 12:30 for my room. Clean but ULTRA SMALL. Walls very thin and you wake up when people are leaving for their early morning flights. They did not credit my Best western points and I cant do it online so I have to fax my receipt to Best Western. Guess I will give Best Western another chance at another property
UR73468306	The recioptionists were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was in a central location. Near to local restaurants and shops. It had a metro station on each side of the road which was ideal Being on a side street the hotel was abit tricky to find. But it was a great hotel for a weekend break
UR65890878	Good location - 1 minute walk to Gran Via & easy walking distance to most main attractions. Best of all, great price for where you are. The rooms are a decent size with the basic amenities - mini bar, safe & TV - but most importantly, clean. The staff are friendly. My rate didn't include breakfast but that was fine as I could experience it the 'local way' with a cup of chocolcate with churros nearby.
UR63432791	When we booked, we were able to find a great rate and the location made it worth the stay. The rooms clearly hadn't been non-smoking for long and everything stunk. The size of the room and bathroom were large and huge by European standards. Didn't realize the breakfast did not come with the room rate and ended up having to pay something ridiculous for brown fruit and stale bread. We had a really hard time finding the name of the street that the hotel was own, but at least it is really close to a main metro stop. I wouldn't return to this hotel again unless I found it up for a great deal, there wasn't really anything pleasant about it, but it also wasn't horrible.
UR57451825	I did stay one night on 9.2. and two nights over the weekend 20.-22.2. and had a single very small room, but it was perfect for me, bathtub and shower, a locker safe that cost 1 euro per use (open and close) for safety and a TV and minibar. The side street was a little bit dark and "back street" like at night, but overall I have a very pleasant stay, very helpful staff that even gave me an umbrella for one day when it rained and I did not have one with me - without charging me for it. They have WIFI Internet and Internet computer you can use with coins that was allright, one night the Internet connection was quite slow, but thats not the problem of the hotel and rather Telefonica itself. Anything is in walking distance and they have a 11 Euro Shuttle to the airport which you can book one day before. I used it once, the other time the connection with the METRO was just fine. My room was quite small overall and one night it was a little bit loud in the hallway as I seem I had some party people a few doors next to me, but overall I would come back to the hotel, as the entrance of the hotel is guarded at night and you have to ring a bell to get in, so security is very good.
UR56535226	This hotel is awful. Old, dirty, and the rooms are the worst part. The room is tiny (about 12 ft x 8 ft) and is really old. The elevator is about 3 ft x 3 ft as well! The bathtub is half the size of a normal tube. The rooms are also dark and stuffy... you can't get sunlight in here if your life depended on it. Looked like a jail cell to me. The back alleys near by and pretty shady too. For all the American travelers this hotel is basically a Motel 6 except everything is half the size! 1.5 to 2 stars at best.
UR45843288	We think only reason they have three stars is the location. We got a decent rate for two night stay, but would not go to this hotel again. Rooms were dark with no window to the sun and evening staff not very welcoming (morning staff at check out was good though, a smile makes such a difference!). Location is very central with atleast 3 metro stations in a five minutes radius. I think driving and parking would be difficult though. Also a large El Corte Inlges nearby and plenty of places for a quick breakfast. Madrid's layout is not very car friendly, so if you go by taxi after 7am allow plenty of time. If you go to Atocha train station after 8am use Metro or you will be stuck. Our room was ok, spacious with two large beds. Amenities looked like refilled so we didnt take the chance on using them. There was a bathtub which was good for our infant. Overall it was convenient and pretty decent rate to stay there, but next time would upgrade for EUR 20-30 to stay somewhere better.
UR44236744	First of all, location is a little sketchy, but if you stay a few blocks away you'll feel MUCH safer. You may ask how a hotel can refuse to let you check out, but this one did. We went up to our room to find that it smelled horribly of cat urine (and I am not picky by any means!), so we decided to try and go check out immediately and stay somewhere else. They would NOT let us check out and print off a receipt showing that we were leaving. That said, we had no proof to show Expedia that we did not stay there and meanwhile, they had our credit card and passport info that they could have done a number of things with - especially since we are foreigners! We weren't even asking for our money back. We just wanted to CHECK OUT! To make matters worse, when Expedia contacted them about the matter, they LIED straight out and told them we never complained, when in fact, we had a one hour argument with them for a stupid proof of check out. I think it's because we were American. If you want a nice place to stay, check out the Vincci Capitol right on Gran Via. Staff there is excellent, helpful and friendly and the location is absolutely perfect for just about the same price!!
UR39752980	I stayed 5 nights in Madrid in this hotel, since I often choose BW hotels and have always found them to give great value for money. It also had a special offer for € 233 for a single room. The location is also great, 3 minutes walk from Callao tube station. Unfortunately, the room was about 8 m2 bath included (see photos) and the air conditioning seemed to work only under 24 °c otherwise it would stop all of a sudden and leave you to face the 35 °c of the summer nights of Madrid. There was a little window that opened to an inner "court" (see photo). The safebox had a key instead of the code, this implying the risk of taking the key with you while touring around town. The staff was very nice and the street was very quiet (one thing you cannot give for granted in downtown Madrid). In conclusion, the hotel could probably be ok unless you get room 111.
UR38674115	The Good: *************** -AWESOME cancellation policy. My travel plans can fluctuate often, and I would be able to cancel until 6PM Madrid time day-of-arrival when booking directly through Best Western. -Honors several discount rates like AAA, CAA and special internet rates (check BW website) -Extremely clean, well maintained room. One of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed at, and I travel often. Room was absolutely immaculate. -Accessible to all Madrid attractions via foot or Metro within a few minutes. -Extremely easy airport transfer using Metro. It's a quick walk to the closest stop (Plaza de Espana) -Bathroom was large by European standards; great shower pressure, nice towels. -Free WiFi and a PC in the lobby (.50 euro for 15 mins) -Efficient desk staff with decent English skills (although they did not go out of their way to make us feel welcome...) Free maps and area info, newspapers, etc at the desk. -Quiet area; Avoided the traffic and noise of staying on Gran Via, but still only 30 seconds away -Close to many restaurants, so no need to eat at the hotel. The Bad: *************** -Air Conditioning was weak. Barely cooled the room and mostly just blew warm air around. -Firm beds with only 1 pillow (but nice linens) -Our safe did not work, so we were forced to walk around Madrid with our passports, iPhones, wallets, etc which I did not think was ideal. If my Spanish was better I would have dealt with this. MY ADVICE & NOTES: *************** I would stay here again. Decent deal for around 60 euro. Book your room through Best Westerns official website rather than a 3rd party like Expedia or Hotels.com so you'll have their good cancellation policy and special rates. Be aware that they will ask for the passport of everyone staying in the room and will make copies of them; this made me a little bit weary but I think most hotels in Spain do this. Also, familiarize yourself with the location of the hotel PRIOR to arrival because it can be rather confusing since it's tucked away between two side streets.
UR38536677	Nothing special here. A decent, affordable hotel with small/medium sized rooms. Mainly to be used to access the city for a few nights. The tube station is pretty much round the corner and you can reach most places in madrid by that way. You can walk to the main palacial gardens and markets from here, though you'll sweat. Access from the airport is easy, just pay the 2 euros and hop on the tube, change lines 2 times and bingo, hotel in 45mins. I never tried the breakfast, there's plenty of food options around the corner anyway. The aircon is fine, and the bathroom facilities are decent. I didnt find noise a problem and other guests were a mixture from the continent. Perhaps the only minor drawback is that its 50metres off the main road. But that's a blessing with the traffic around. I got this hotel plus flight fairly cheaply through internet package, very happy.
UR34360169	I only paid $70(cdn) per night. You get what you pay for. It was the lowest price hotel I could find that was not a Hostel. the rooms were clean. great location, but the rooms were very small and the lobby was tiny. The Staff was very helpful and nice. they all spoke English. If you stay there, its a clean place to sleep, and it has great location.
UR29035734	The hotel is clean and conveniently located close to everything downtown Madrid and in a relatively safe and quiet are off Grand Via. The staff was friendly and willing to help and speak some English but on a warm day I was told by the manager on duty that they could not run the air conditioning since "the heating had been on that morning" (?!). The beds are quite hard by US standards but fairly typical of European hotels. The rooms are small - so don't plan on staying in too long. Some rooms face a back yard and there is no view whatsoever. The price was reasonable.
UR24208465	My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Hotel Los Condes in January 2009 for 4 nights. The hotel is in a small side street off the Grand Via, one of the main roads in Madrid. The fixtures in the rooms seemed slightly dated, but it is well maintained and clean. It is very close to the Callao metro stop, a 15-20 minute walk to the Palacio Real. Also, if you use the Metro, it is only a few stops away from the nightlife areas. The staff in the hotel were efficient and helpful. There is also a self service laundry adjacent to the hotel, which we found really convenient, as we were travelling for an extended period of time, and had to do our laundry. On the Grand Via you will find many restaurants for meals. If you are looking for a convenient place to stay close to the city centre, this would be the place.
UR24168189	Hotel is situated in a side road off the Gran Via in a central location. It was nice and clean and the staff were quite friendly. Biggest downside is if you have a room with a window as it was very noisy, very noisy until the very early hours of the morning. Also if you like to have coffee/tea facilities in your room take your own as even though it is advertised on the hotel's website, the hotel do not provide these.
UR21005210	this hotel was really a pleasant surprise. the rooms are very small and it's not for who wants to spend the whole day inside the room. but the room and the hotel is very clean, smelled good, newly renovated, central location, very quiet, nice and new wood everywhere, marble bathroom, taps worked perfectly, hair dryer, magnifier mirror, refrigerator, tv channels, comfortable closet, everything was really well taken care of. and the price very in line. i would go back to it.
UR20265398	Bill Arons, Melbourne Australia I've now stayed at this hotel three times and my friend has stayed there twice. The staff are excellent, friendly and helpful and get things done quickly should they go wrong, or if you have problems in your room. Eg. I had a faulty phone. I've stayed twice in room 504. Small, tight, but comfortable and good value at about 60 euros. The main thing though was it was quiet! Position wise it's hard to beat. Three minutes walk to the Grand Via. Seven to ten minutes to Plaza de España (See the statue of Don Quijote). Unbeatable central location. The down side is that it's about 200 yards from a down market area, on the up side though there's a very cheap Asian supermarket at the top of the square that's very handy. Would I or my wife stay there again?. Yes a great little place.
UR17757714	A small hotel located in the centre of Madrid just a few steps away from the metro, restaurants, tour bus, shopping, Gran Via etc - in fact everything. A little difficult to find initially especially if driving a car. Best Tip- forget the car use the public transport- faster, cheaper and safer. The staff were excellent and could not do enough for us ( A family consisting of Grandparents (youthful), parents and a 8 year old girl.). Always a cheery smile and more than willing to help in any way they can. Please do not be put off by the lane you have to go up to get to the hotel. It is tacky but we never had any problems in it or the surrounding similarly small lanes. Madrid itself is a delight. and we will be heading back soon and guess where we will stay - Los Condes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UR15298146	Lovely little hotel in a great location. Situated in a quiet but central area just off the Gran Via and close to the metro. Very clean with helpful staff. We arrived after an over night flight at 9am and were given our room straight away at no extra charge. All that we needed was to hand and the all important laundromat a few steps away (after 12 days in Morrocco very important). Very reasonable cost for central Madrid.
UR8241122	The Los Condes is located a short walk from Metro Callao in the heart of Madrid, about 40 minutes by metro from Madrid Airport. If you have a lot of luggage, you will have abouta ten minute walk from the station (conservative estimate). The lobby area is very small but right near the entrance is a large common area with Spanish newspapers and an Internet terminal that you can use for the reasonable price of 0.50 EUR/15 min. Check-in went very smoothly. My room was a large single on the inner part of the hotel, which gave me a nice view .... of the rest of the building. No courtyard view to speak of. But that didn't bother me. In the room, there is a mini-bar, work desk, one AC outlet near the desk, a TV with several non-Spanish channels, and a semi-double bed. In the bathroom, there is a large tub, toilet and sink, although the sink area is awkwardly designed. (There was a shelf for the amenities but it jutted out directly over the faucet, which meant that you sometimes bumped your head if you bent down near the faucet to wash your face.) Nearby the hotel, there are a number of places to eat, and, for those who need to know, a McDonald's and KFC (all the way to Madrid to eat American fast food?) More importantly, it's a good area to be, except for the street it's on, which can be dark and empty. (The hotel is right next to the area's Chinatown.) Just five minutes away is the shopping district that leads down to Sol, with its Fnac multimedia shop and several branches of the omnipresent ElCorte Ingles department store. (The El Corte Ingles is a good place to get basic foodstuffs and bottled water.) Beyond Sol there are even more places to eat, so in a sense, using this hotel to launch your explorations of Madrid is not such a bad idea. There are better places to stay at, however, if you can find a reasonable rate at this place (for, say, less than 50 EUR) then it might be better staying at a full-service hotel like this than at a hostel (hostal) which will cost 40 EUR for a single traveller.
UR5478459	I was a bit apprehensive about staying at the Best Western Hotel Los Condes after reading some of the other reviews, but after staying there for four nights in June 2006, I have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with mini bar and air conditioning - which is a 'must' in Madrid during the summer. The decor of the bathrooms is a bit 1980s, but this is of little importance as everything is kept very clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is good - just off the Gran Via and a 5 minute walk to the metro. It is neither the best nor the worst area of Madrid. Walking towards the Gran Via and metro, you will walk along a quiet side street - Calle Los Libreros. I felt comfortable at all times walking with my friends, but I doubt I would have felt as relaxed had I been on my own after dark. But this would apply anywhere in any city. One word of advice about Madrid - ALWAYS KEEP A FIRM HOLD ON YOUR BAG - wherever you are!! I was unlucky enough to have my handbag stolen while sitting in an indoor café on the Gran Via one morning. Pickpockets and thieves are everywhere in Madrid. As long as you are careful you'll have a great time!
UR4695179	This an excellent hotel. It was an excellent time for me. In a very quiet street, very near of the tube, very near of the center, very near of all!! My room was very good, very clean, very tidy, and big. The staff were absolutley friendly. The beds were good, and the bathroom excellent!! If I come back to Madrid, I will go there absolutely without thinking it. The price is also good. It was better than the photos of the travel agency. I recommended you absolutely!
UR3982323	This is a good hotel in a good location for exploring Madrid.As in most areas of the city a lot of building work is underway.The staff are helpful and polite.My only criticism is the beds are very hard but some may like that!A good budget hotel.
UR139576322	We were in this hotel for one week. It has spacious room, very comfortable beds, great location and very easy transport accessibility. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would return here without hesitation.
UR138969479	I was in large group of people from different Parliaments worldwide for seminar organized by Congreso de los Diputados, on March this year. We stayed at the Hotel for two weeks and I must say that during that period I felt almost like home, so - everything was great – room, hotel, service, bar, location, even - wine bar opposite of the hotel front door is superb. The food in the hotel is regular, means ok. Yes, I have to admit, that Israel's front desk team was great by solving some of my special needs regarding my room. That hotel is my recommendation!
UR138589407	Stayed here back in July when rooms in Chueca are at a premium. The hotel was reasonably priced, perfectly located, had a friendly staff, and was very clean. My only complaint is that the beds were overly hard Also, as someone else mentioned, the pictures of the rooftop pool are VERY deceiving. It's essentially a hot tub and the space is so small that it only holds 2 lounge chairs. Still, if you know all of that ahead of time, you can't go wrong here.
UR136887964	The location is great, this is true. Very central. And the lunches were okay (aside from the restaurant staff not understanding that the vegetarian in our group was not vegan...). However, if you are planning to have a meeting with this hotel, I would strongly recommend going elsewhere. The conference staff are incredibly disorganized and unhelpful, and were very inflexible with basic changes and/or requests that a normal meeting situation demands. The meeting spaces themselves are small and smelled terrible (ie: at best, dusty and stale, at worst, like an overflowing toilet). Water and coffee were not refreshed throughout the day and we kept running out (although we paid a LOT for this service), and there were a lot of mistakes, delays and confusion overall. In terms of the hotel rooms, they were average but fine. Good towels. The pool is very small and thus FULL of people and very cloudy water. The pool opening hours were also inconvenient. All in all, as a place to stay as a tourist, it is average at best. And for business, I would not recommend it at all.
UR136268862	Stayed for two nights in July. The room was lovely, very large with a great bathroom. The hotel location is very good, within walking distance of most of the main sights. The rooftop pool area is a nice addition, however be aware that it is very small. Only about 6 people can fit comfortably in the area so most of the time it's to busy to be used. Overall I thought this was a great hotel and a bargain for £50 per night.
UR136203168	I went to Madrid for the first time a couple of weeks ago, as I have never been in Madrid I wanted to find a hotel close to everything and Catalonia Gran Via lived up to my expectations. I rate the hotel as a typical 4-star hotel.
UR136161343	Stayed for two nights on a short business trip. Booked the hotel directly from their website. Great location and big rooms. I got a double room, and like many in Europe, it was two single beds pushed together. Room had a mini bar and free WiFi. However, internet access was very very very slow. Speedtest rated it as only 0.200 Mbps. But fast enough for a Skype call. Had breakfast everyday in a small cafe around the corner. 3.25 vs 19 euro :-)
UR135421307	I often use this hotel for business. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The rooms sometimes are ok, but some need a refurbishment and are not in good conditions for a 4 star hotel. Location is perfect. I would suggest the manager to keep the pool open from sunrise to sunset. The fact that the woman that cleans the swimming pool area leaves at 8pm is a poor explanation to close the pool at 8. Customers that want to relax after a hard day visiting the city or working can't do it many times. When my room is near rhe swimming pool I see people trying to use that facility before noticing it's closed.
UR134345302	There is a lesson to be learnt - if you want a double bed you need to specify that in the booking-myself and my wife booked in for our romantic weekend and were shown a room with twin beds - it took over an hour of complaining before we finally were given a double room we thought we'd booked (albeit we had to change after the first night) The lack of empathy and help was marked and we lost an hour of our first evening battling with their staff with very little apology.... Also dont be fooled by the picture of the pool it is extremely tiny and just 4 or 5 sun beds and the roof pool is packed.... Nice central location between the main park, shops and Plaza Major just a short walk away... Overall the rooms are spacious and clean although given our experience we won't be going back!!
UR133916974	Great hotel on centrally located Gran Via, walking distance to Puerta del Sol, Chueca, Retiro park and most central attractions. Nice rooms, good service and the pool on the roof is brilliant. Not massive and busy at certain times (4-6), but lovely for a refreshing dip after a hot Madrid day. Breakfast available in the hotel but we had lovely breakfast and cortados con hielo at Mercado de la Reina across the road, much recommended. Loved Madrid, can't wait to go back.
UR133256931	The price is higher than the same standard you can get in others similar hotels in Europe. But this justify a very good position in the city centre. Service is likely positive. Rooms are cleaned. A good compromise especially for business staying.
UR131760900	Located perfectly in the Gran Via aerea. 5 minutes from Puerta Del Sol. 10 minutes from Parque del Retiro. Parking is not really closed from the Hotel and costs 30Euros per day.
UR131361389	I stayed in this hotel for one night in a standard room and was very impressed by it. It is modern and clean, the room was immaculate and a good size - with a separate area by the window with two chairs. Ours was room 321 and I would ask for it again. The only downside was the pool, which we had been looking forward to. It was very small - like a large bath - and there weren't enough loungers. The ones there were were all used - one woman was lying across three and refused to move. maybe just a bad bunch of guests when we visited, but it means we couldn't enjoy the facilities. On the positive side, the location is excellent - plenty of good bars and restaurants nearby and easy walking distance to Madrid's excellent galleries. As a woman alone I felt safe walking around at night as the main road is light, bright and well used.
UR130512555	My friend and I stayed in this hotel and were impressed by it. Hotel is modern and clean. Staff were polite. We asked for a quiet room as we did not want a room facing the main road. Room was at the side and was indeed quiet, did not hear traffic. The room was clean and very tidy. There was a small kind of area off the room with a small table and two chairs, fine if you had time to chill out. Limited English speaking channels on TV but we were not there to watch TV. Roof top pool is clean albeit a small area, a few loungers about but unfortunately we did not have time to use the pool, too busy sight- seeing in a beautiful city. Hotel is well located for the excellent restaurants and tapas bars. Would definitely recommend.
UR129940212	The hotel is in the center of the city, neear to the metro station. It is clean and the staff is frendly. The breakfast was plentiful and diversified. If we will come back to Madrid, Catalonia Grad Via will be our first choise.
UR128360423	I was there for a week, April 15-21, 2012. There was nothing wrong with this hotel at all. I had none of the problems some other reviewers describe. The room was fine, the breakfast buffet was good, my 5th floor room looked out over a side street, but rarely was there much noise. The hotel tended to be a little overheated, but I could open my windows. Wi-fi was free, though it tended to kick off with even brief non-use. You have to sign in often. The location is great, right on Gran Via, two blocks from a Metro stop, four blocks from Puerta Del Sol. I would definitely stay there again.
UR128044418	This hotel is very cheap and well located in the centre of Madrid. I can see why.... It's very dated inside and I had a choice between either a room that smelt terrible or a room with a view of a wall and that's it. Not recommended. Clearly not 4 stars as they say.
UR127171471	It was the louziest **** Hotel I ever stayed worldwide! I was only booked in a Standard-room,3rd floor, although I expected something else! It was below ***! ROOM: The bed was so hard one could have easely slept on the floor. The nice melody of whatever electricity utensils made it unable to sleep through at night. The windows were not even properly insolated, the room with a "view" into the patio (next housewall). The Bathtube showed a lenght for a 10 years old , self I am rather of "barroque appearance". Although the room was very clean. BREAKFAST. Great selection what ever you expect on a breakfast-buffet. In the **** Hotel I liked most the cold fried eggs and the cold baccon!! RECEPTION: The male receptionists were extremly friendly and helpfull in contrary to the females. To say "Thank you and Good Bye"? - Words unknown in that **** Hotel
UR126866179	Again, I can't say this is the nicest four star hotel I've stayed in. Pretty basic amenities and the rooms were basic as well. This was a really great location! It was central to everything in the city. The Reina Sofia was the farthest site we walked to and it was only about 15-20 minutes. El prado is 10 minutes away walking distance and you're very close to a lot of the great restaurants.
UR126359998	This is the greatest location! Small hotel, Many years ago, before remodeling to a hotel, was a mansion. We had booked a double and when we checked in the desk clerk, looking at my 6'2" husband, and my being 5'8",and American suggested we may be more comfortable in a room with twin beds (which could be pushed together) since the European doubles were just that, a small, (by American standards,) double bed... no queen or king!, but we could still have the courtyard view, and balcony for the same rate. (we were glad we did!) The room was quiet, bathroom was immaculate, great shower, etc. etc The the location was just TERRIFIC . Very large breakfast buffet and VERY helpful staff. This is an older EUOPEAN hotel at a very reasonable price. If you get a chance wander around, see the lovely ballroom, the majestic staircase and just imagine what it must have been as a private home!.
UR125633034	we stayed here in February for a long weekend, the Hotel was perfect for our visit, i was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews so was pleasantly surprised. Our room was quite spacious with a sofa and arm chair, large flat screen tv and a good sized double sink bathroom with jacuzzi bath. I found the beds comfortable and both the room and Hotel spotlessly clean. There was a terrace outside the room that you could access through glass sliding doors which was lovely. The Hotel has a little cafe/bar at the entrance which we used frequently for a cuppa and a heat after enduring the freezing cold weather we had whilst here. The breakfast was a huge range of foods, cold meats, toast, cereal, fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs, it was a bit cold so id get there early. The location really is the best thing about this place, we got the subway from the airport which was fast and efficient and the subway station was yards away from the hotel. The city tour bus also stops just across the road. There is a nice shopping area close by which had some lovely looking restaurants unfortunately they were closed at night when we went back to find them. All in all i would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.
UR125164451	I'm here for a 4 nite stay using this hotel as a base for sightseeing. The room is large but i know some rooms are smaller. Basic amenities including a very hard 'Mexican" style single bed. I don't find it terrible but those with American tastes may. My room has a refrigerator and mini bar. has a huge walk in shower plus a full bathtub. Great neighborhood for walking and exloring. Since the bldg is shaped as a rectangle the view is of the back of the bldg. Not a big deal but some view of outside would be preferred. Rooms on the Gran Via side however may be noisy as its a well traveled road. I found the best price by e mailing hotel direct. Easy also to get to. I took the express airport bus from Madrid airport to the Plaza Ciebela stop and walked a few blocks. Easy to do and get a map from Madrid info ctr before hopping on. I think it was the 2nd stop after leaving the airport. The included brkfst really is wonderful and much more extensive than any hotel I've stayed at recently. Overall my impressions are quite good. Free internet in the room was a nice perk and the fact that you can drink the water from the sink. I'd stay here again as I've been able to walk everywhere and took the Metro which stops close by.
UR124272934	The location is great, and the hotel is ok. The breakfast was very good, and for being in such a central location there was almost no noise. The hotel is in a very nice old building. I don't know if we were lucky but our room had a huge terrace with great views. This compensated the fact that the room was not great at all and it was actually quiet difficult to arrive to it as you ad to take an elevator, then some stairs, and then a few hallways. For the price we were paying this was excellent value for money.
UR120379396	We stayed there three nights and everything was really excellent! Great position in down town, on the main road (Gran Via) and easy to reach by bus or tube, wide and refurbished room with all the comforts you can desire: AC, well stocked minibar, courtesy set including bathrobes and slippers, electrical safe, flat screen TV, pillows menu, free Internet Wi.Fi. connection and afternoon tidying, very rich breakfast buffet with fresh juices, many kind of cakes and pastries, eggs, ham. turkey, sausages, cheese, bacon, bread, toastes, yogurt, cereals, teas and so on. A particular mention for the entire staff that was always nice and helpful. We definitively reccomend this hotel to anyone, for business or tourism, and we hope to come back soon
UR119951241	pluses: great location, helpful stuff, minuses: stuffy rooms, overused furniture, in whole - the hotel needs renovation general impression: ok, but the next time I'd rather stay somewhere else
UR119351657	Could not ask for a better location. Easy walk to Puerto del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Santa Ana (for tapas). Also, could walk to the Prado and the Thyssen-Bornremisza Museum. Good bar across street for tapas. Stayed 5 nights beginning Spetember 29th with Road Scholar. Seemed to be mainly a tour group hotel. As many as three groups at a time. Breakfast was good. The biggest negative was that half the rooms did not have air conditioning. From what I could make out there was a problem with the system that affected many rooms. Windows open, but street noise is lound. My ipod helped a lot for getting to sleep, but garbage trucks at 3:30 were my wake up call. In room safe has a daily charge, which was waived for our group, but there was a 20 Euro deposit for the key. Front desk staff spoke English well. Would probably not stay there again.
UR116839043	Stayed for 6 nights with my family at wonderful Madrid in this hotel. Good: LOCATION! We walked everywhere by foot with 2 kids aged 7 and 10! Rooms are clean. Got 2 rooms with connecting doors, as we asked a few days before arrival. They were at 1st floor facing a patio, so they were very quiet. Breakfast buffet was good (although we twice found sanitary issues). Bad: We woke up sometimes in the morning form waiking up calls to other rooms. Bathroom cosmetics: Only Shampoo and soap bar are provided. Bottom line: I would go there again. Fair price for reasonalble value.
UR116589518	Spent 4 nights at this hotel as part of a large family vacation. 20 people total. The staff was wonderful. Our rooms were ready for us early which was so nice after a long flight from the US. Our room was spacious and quiet. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Would definitely stay here again.
UR116214399	The Hotel is in a great location, within easy walking distance to many of the main attractions. The staff did not appear to speak much english, but it waas a good opportunity for me to practice my Spanish. The bar staff and waitresses were very friendly and polite. The room was a good size with a reasonably stocked mini bar. Bathroom was very clean. Overall I was happy and didn't spend a fortune, I would stay there again
UR115465407	The location couldn't be better - an easy walk to the Prado, Thyssen, Puerta del Sol, and Plaza Mayor. Truly the heart of Madrid. We had a huge, comfortable room and large bathroom. The breakfast was excellent. The desk clerk was very helpful and printed our boarding passes for our flight home. If we return to Madrid we'll stay here again.
UR69849662	The room was quiet but dark; You have to pay extra for everything that should be included in a four star property: inroom safe, internet (expensive). The hotel needs to be refurbished. Hotel staff ok but not welcoming and not really interested in the well being of the guest. Hotel catering a lot for tour groups I think. All in all an experience i will not renew.
UR68623862	This hotel from the outside looked grand & palatial,however the public areas are not of a 4 star standard with tired & worn furnishings in the reception area ,great view looking up the main staircase atrium, we had a room on the floor at the front overlooking Gran Via. The room it self was to say the least very dissapointing the small occasional table was of IKEA quality & was chipped,the armchairs were rickety & worn fabric, no lock on bathroom door. The overall decor was not of a particularly high standard.The corridors on our floor were dark & dingy & had the appearance of an old office interior. Location wise its spot on for central Madrid,at best this hotel is a 3 star hotel in a 4 star location.
UR67372396	We read many of the reviews before booking the hotel. This hotel was well priced- important since we had 2 rooms. We wanted a base station to be able to walk anywhere in Old Madrid. Walks to the Real Palace, Plaza Mayor, the 3 museums, Retiro Park, Royal Gardens were easy from this location just north of Puerto de Sol. It would have been nice to have a rooftop lounge area- but we were touring most of the day. Breakfast was fine and part of the room rates. Our rooms were extremely quiet, facing away from the Gran Via. The Gran Via was easy to stroll at night safely. It seems to be a popular strolling avenue.
UR63167321	We booked the Catalonia Las Cortes. When we arrived, there was construction in the street and they offered to transfer us to the Catalonia Gaudi for the same rate and they threw in the breakfast. When the hotel hired taxi took us to the Gaudi, we checked in and told them we would be staying tor 4 nights. They told us they only had a room for one night. I told the receptionist that I was not about to move to another hotel. She proceeded to call the Catalonia Las Cortes and gave us a room for the 4 nights. The rooms were large but outdated and dark. No AC and it was warm in Madrid. No help with our luggage. Bathroom was modern and clean. Good breakfast but expensive. Location was great for exploring Madrid. We were able to walk to all the sights of interest and did not have to take the metro. The staff was not very pleasant and seemed bothered when we asked for information or assistance. Maybe it is a Madrid thing, but hotel personnel in Andalusia were much more pleasant than the folks we encountered in Madrid hotel. By the way, we speak fluent Spanish. Bottom line, I would pick another hotel for my next trip to Madrid. Definitely not a 4 star hotel. Two stars at best.
UR60514647	After an 8 night stay at the Gaudi, I was pleased with the location and the overall hotel. Being on Gran Via made life easy and the restaurants in Chueca were amazing. The staff was pleasant and when needed very helpful (just don't ask them for advice on where to eat). The rooms are small but clean and the beds are just ok. Getting around the city was very easy and if you need to take a taxi it is around 5 euro. No one really speaks English but you can get by. We travelled with 6 people, two of which were elderly. When ordering in do not order Paella for 6 it's way too much and pricey. On the first day or so take the cheesy double decker tour, it will allow you to see all of the city and map out what you want to do and it's location. We had a problem with a leak in our room and were moved within 15minutes in the middle of the night. We got a suite with two balconies overlooking the Gran Via....beautiful and surprisingly quiet. Breakfast was good and again no one really smiles. I would stay here for the location and definitely for the access to Chueca.
UR58390858	I booked the Catalonia Gaudi at the last minute for a one night stay after a business trip. The price attracted me the most and upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is modern , clean, nice sized rooms with inner bedroom door for peace and quite and friendly staff. It's also greatly located on Gran Via which is at the hart of Madrid. Great location for going out in the evening. It's a 2 minute walk to Gran Via metro station and therefore fantastic for getting around the city. The hotel also have a secure room for storing your bags upon check out. This meant I could make the most of my last day around the city. Don't understand why it was such good vale. I would have paid more.
UR39159912	I was very impressed with Catalonia Gaudi. First I’ve booked the hotel through booking.com and was surprised with the low price for a hotel so well located. In fact its location is extraordinary: next to several subway stations (Gran Via and Bank of Spain), 10 minutes walk away from Chueca and Puerta del Sol. I’ve travelled with my wife, my sister and my brother in law. Our room was very good and big (it had a sofa in front of the TV and a huge bathroom) however my sister’s was smaller (but comfortable too). I believe that I was just lucky because the standard rooms should be like the one of my sister. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
UR34856539	If it is more important to have a downtown Madrid experience than is it to have a great room than this is your place. The rooms are small and have old furniture, but the location is in the center of the Gran Via of Madrid. Hotel is within walking distance of important downtown monuments and more excellent restaurants than you will ever need.
UR33377653	We were on a tour - this hotel's location was fabulous - right in the middle of everything, but we were disappointed with the rooms - they were a bit shabby and the customer service wasn't very impressive. The hotel seemed very understaffed - from the front desk right down to the little bar off the lobby. Not sure how it stacks up price-wise (as mentioned, we were on a tour), but if it's pricey, keep looking. Otherwise, it's Ok for a few days. Decent buffet breakfst - gotta give them credit for that!"
UR32639405	While we were there for 3 nights someone pulled the fire alarm late at night and they wouldn't offer anything like breakfast free the next morning, we had been informed breakfast was included but it wasn't, and parking was ridiculous to find. The lot they recommend is pricy. However, we loved Madrid and the central location was great.
UR29462825	Lovely, Clean and spacious Hotel with friendly and helpful staff, ideally situated for all main attractions, the metro and tour buses. Enjoyed a delicious meal in the restrurant, not too expensive, excellent value for money, the waiting on staff were lovely. Will return again.
UR26988778	It's true the interiors are a bit dated, but the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The location was perfect and decent value for money. Breakfast was five star too and included in the rate.
UR22575397	The hotel was OK. The location in the center of Madrid is great. It is easy to get to the shopping streets and great restaurants, and an easy walk to Plaza Mayor and Plaza del Sol. The room was big and nice, but looks old with the brown wood on the walls. It was like living in a closet. Breakfast was fin with hot english breakfast and Spanish tapas. The receptionist was not very serviceminded and they did not have time ti guide or talk to the guest. I was more important to look down and do nothing. Bring af guide book because you will not get any help from the staff. But over all a nice stay!
UR22370471	I stayed here along with a friend in November 2008 for 3 nights. We found a really good deal on the Hotel's website. In brief, the hotel is very clean, bathroom is spacious; good supply of toiletries, towels etc. The beds in the room were both very comfortable with lots of pillows, wooden panel floors; but this wasn't an issue either. Well stocked and pretty reasonable minibar prices in comparison to other minibar prices in other hotels. The hotel does has heating but there is no air conditioning. We both found that even in the winter, the rooms could get a bit warm and there is no natural ventilation i.e one cannot open the windows. Staff friendly and helpful; both my friend and I speak Spanish but I believe they do speak good English. Location is very good, close to the Metro and on Gran Via. We used the Metro frequently and didn't have any problems. Having said that I've used the Metro in most European cities and not had any issues. Having said that, we were mindful of our positioning on the Metro especially at busy times; by that, I mean, standing in such a manner where it would be difficult for anyone to thief of you. Again, my friend and I probably didn't look like tourists as we didn't carry valuables, cameras etc. As per the previous reviewer, it is disappointing when such crimes are committed on holiday. At night I felt safe walking home as the local area is well policed, especially at the weekend. Wouldn't have an issue staying here again if the price were reasonable. I wouldn't pay more than £75 $130 a night though.
UR22170407	Football squad of 19 stayed at the Gaudi for 3 nights in November 08. The hotel is an excellent location for the sights of Madrid, situated near one end of the Gran Via. However you should be warned that about 200 yards away, just off the Gran Via, are permanently stationed prostitutes who appear to ply their trade quited openly 24/7. It has to be some sort of tolerance zone as it is always well policed, so it's not particularly threatening but it wasn't in the brochure !! Anyway, back to the hotel. Clean, spacious rooms, good shower etc, sound-proofed (at least those not facing Gran Via were OK), plenty of wardrobe space and proper coat-hangers (i.e. not the ones which assume you're a thief). Lifts were fine too. Breakfast selection was good, served up to 11.00, decent bar (but shuts at midnight), safe facilities in each room and a quality TV with plenty of channels. Staff polite and friendly, speak English. Were especially helpful when one of our number was robbed on the metro (by the way, don't expect any help from the British Embassy, total waste of space). Which brings me to an unfortunate feature of Madrid - the thieving vermin who prey on tourists. Another one of our number had his pocket dipped - you really have to watch your possessions like a hawk. 2 out 19 robbed and a couple of near misses. I've travelled quite extensively around Europe, my wife was robbed in Barcelona and two of our group in Madrid. Don't tell me the police don't know the culprits - they need to get this vermin off the streets. How are you supposed to enjoy a relaxing break when you are in constant fear of being robbed. Finally, went to the Bernabau to see a Real Madrid game. Box Office ticket prices were extortionate, ended up getting tickets off a tout. The shop in the city centre which sells tickets remained closed (despite the notice in the window saying it should be open) and one of the locals commented that they just opened when they felt like it. Manana. Overall, good hotel, stay enjoyable though soured by the thieves. Good cheap food at Zaharas on Gran Via, plenty of selection down the side streets, quality souvenirs on Floor 7 of Cortes Inglese.
UR21686212	I choosed this hotel for its location, in the centre of Madrid. There is a metro stop within a 4 minutes walk, and around the corner there are many restaurants and bars. The decoration of the room was a bit run down and dated, and the room was reasonable seized but dark, as the only window led to a small interior courtyard, but then no noise at all from the busy Gran Via. The only view was a wall about 3 meters away from our window. The modern bathroom was very nice and clean . The bed was very confortable also. Very good breakfast (worth the 15 euro) and friendly staff. Maybe a 3 ½ star not a 4 star hotel.
UR21227604	We stayed at this hotel for six nights in October, the front desk was very helpful to us, especially Sandra, the included breakfast buffet was more than adequate, the rooms very clean and surprisingly quiet being on the Gran Via. Overall, a nice stay in Madird.
UR20841866	on a very busy main road. went for a conference - had bag stolen from dining room at breakfast - conference room was in basement with no windows - bedroom was so noisy that we had to change rooms. there are much better hotels to stay at in madrid and would have checked out if we had not paid in advance. the condom machine opposite the lift was presumably there to provide a need created by some of the 'ladies' in the bar late at night.
UR18466090	Went for a weekend away without the kids. We had a great time and found the hotel superb. Not sure if our room was a standard room, but it was amazing. Big room, big bathroom, and we had two jaccuzzi's. One on the balcony and one in the bathroom. Very nice. In terms of location, very central, and we walked everywhere with ease. Staff very helpful, all in all, a great hotel.
UR15794772	We stayed at the Gaudi 30.4.08 - 4.5.08. Not our first nor second choice but the ones we wanted were fully booked. The hotel is in a great location, you can walk every where. No major complaints, just a bunch of little things. Breakfast was good, but irritating that there was NEVER an opened sparkling wine bottle, nor any champagne glasses available - had to be asked for... Hotel a bit run down and drab, but as we really did nothing more than sleep there it was adequate. Pillows uncomfortable. The in-room safe that you have to pay extra for is ridicoulous - they should just charge 5 eur more per night and include it in the price, also update to new digital safes so that you do not have to carry the key around with you. Madrid is a great city and we loved it! Would love to go back some day. Would I stay at the Gaudi again? No, next time we will book earlier and get the hotel we really want.
UR15466994	Just come back from a 4 days stay at this Hotel and would definately go back ,It is in great spot for all sight seeing and shopping.The Hotel upgraded our room to one of the suites which was great ,as we even had hot tub bath on an outdoor terrace with great views and jaccuzi bath inside the room.. The decor is typical of a city hotel but nice and very clean. The bed was a superking size bed and very comfortable. We were on the top floor and a bit of traffic noise could be heard from outside but it was not a problem.Massive selection at breakfast including bacon,egg,croissants,cakes,bread,jams,sparkling wine,tea,coffee,juice,cereals,toast,cheese,ham,salami,too much choice. Great selection of toiletries which included,razor,toothbrush,sewing kits,nail files,tissues ,shoe shine plus the usual shampoos etc were provided in the room. Even little sweets each day. The staff were very friendly and room service very efficient ,and not too expensive. If you do visit Madrid you must go to Ginger restaurant,Plaza Angel ,great food and inexpensive but quality food.Taxis from the airport cost 25-30 euros approx.Tour bus worth doing.
UR12386561	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel A Gaudi for a week at the end of August / start of September on a last minute break. We loved Madrid and the hotel is so central that it's literally moments from all of the shops, bars, clubs and restaurants. There is also a metro stop within 5 minutes walk. The road could be heard but was not a problem as it's the pay off between the location and the noise and we certainly had no problems with it. We went room only so cannot comment on the food, but the staff were friendly, rooms were clean and we would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Madrid.
UR12312421	We enjoyed out stay at the Hotel A. Gaudi (aka Catalonia Gaudi) in November. The room was clean, quiet and roomy with comfortable beds. There were two big windows that opened allowing airflow but no view out of the windows as they opened to the inside---not a big deal to us as we weren't there for the view out the windows! The staff at the front desk was friendly but not overly helpful with recommending restaurants, etc. They did take care of calling a cab for us on our last day there. There is one computer with internet access that can be used for a fee (slide credit card). There is a safe in the room which requires a 20 euro deposit and a fee of 3,9 euros/day. The location is very centrally located and there is only a short walk (a block or two) to the nearest Metro station. The breakfast was included in our price and was a perfect way to start our day! Huge variety of fresh fruits and pastries, eggs, sausage, cheeses, meats, cereals, fresh juices, sparkling wine, on and on. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Madrid!
UR10190464	Five friends stayed here last weekend and were really impressed with the rooms and the location. The rooms was lovely and very clean. The breakfast was good with lots of selection - although the eggs were a bit cold, but there was plenty of choice. The one complaint I would have was the bar staff were quite slow, only ever one on and at peak times this was not good enough. Some of us had rooms at the back of the hotel and it was so, so quite - recommend asking. But the best thing about this hotel is definately the location, we could not have asked for better.
UR10078375	Stayed here for 4 nights on our recent trip to Spain. The ceiling leaked two times in two days when it rained in different locations and made the room musty smelling. There was no iron available in the entire hotel for pressing. The front desk staff was young and uninformed about everything. The only 2 good things were the location, near to the metro and the Prado museum, and the included breakfast buffet. It is really only a 2 star hotel. Stay at your own risk!!
UR8702796	Four star hotel and worth it! Friendly and helpfull staff, clean and good rooms. Good location at the Gran Via, the center of town. No traffic noise due to the good isolation. Extensive breakfast.
UR8230018	Stayed at hotel for 3 days July 5h-8th. Hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to all major sights and museums. Rooms were very clean, not huge but perfectly fine. The floors had laminate flooring which was actually nice. Carpet can sometimes be gross. The buffet breakfast which was included was excellent. Everything from eggs, pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit and cereal. The staff was very helpful. They recommended a great paella restaurant very close by, all spoke english and were happy to help with directions. This is a very nice hotel in a great location. I am a pretty picky person and I was very pleased.
UR7772026	This is a lovely, very convenient hotel. It is very good value. The rooms were spotlessly clean, the beds were comfortable and the breakfast buffet selection was incredibly good. Although there were large groups staying there we didn't hear them at all (the sound proofing is obviously very good as I am a very light sleeper) and the staff were all very helpful. It is very convenient for all the madrid attractions and there are loads of lovely restaurants within a 5 minute radius of the hotel. We enjoyed our stay so much that we went back a couple of weeks later for another night on the way back through madrid and it was just as nice the second time. I'd definately recommend it and I would definately go back. (The only idiotic thing is that they charge 4 euros per night to use the safe in your room and require a 20 euro cash deposit - they won't take a credit card deposit etc which is all very bizarre!!)
UR7631456	This was our 7th visit to this wonderful city but the hotel was probably our least favourite. Nothing particularly wrong, but the room was dark and fairly plain. 2 single beds. Nice modern bathroom. There wasn't a view except for a wall about 6 feet away from our window (Room 309). Breakfast was an extra 15 euros, which we declined. The location can't be faulted. Handy for all the sights. We find Madrid a very easy city to get around and none of the major sights are more than about 20 minutes walk away. Metro stops are everywhere and this is a great way to get around too. Minor problem here. I was pick-pocketed in the metro but they only got my specs in their case so they dropped them when they found out what they were. A close shave. We,ve stayed at Emperador, Carlos V, Opera and Florida Norte and would say they were all better than the Gaudi. Lastly, we went into the stylish De LasLetras next door for a nightcap..lovely ambiance...but 2 Gins and Tonic......25 euros!!!
UR7226279	Very helpful staff,central location for all the sights.Room cleaned well every day.Good choice of breakfast but hot food could have been hotter.spacious room very quiet !
UR6815238	We stayed at the Hotel A. Gaudi for 3 nights and enjoyed the hotel, however i would only consider this a 3* standard. The room was relatively small, although it did have a nice enclosed balcony which added character. We stayed in a room facing the main road, although noise was not an issue. The location is perfect, especially if want to visit the museums. I would recommend this hotel, but only if you can get it at discounted prices, it would not be worth the full price they suggest.
UR5322732	My wife and I stayed there for 3 nights at the end of May. We found the staff friendly and helpful, in stark contrast to many of the people we encountered in Madrid, especially in restaurants. The room was nice, though a little small, and there were two twin beds. The breakfast and location were great. For a 3 1/2 star hotel, we were generally pleased.
UR5224029	We spent 2 nights at the Hotel Gaudi. It was fine. The negatives were few, one being that we requested a non-smoking room and as with many hotels it was clear that people had smoked in the room. Both of us are highly allergic to the smoke so that was frustrating. The second was the "fitness center", which as with most hotels was a hotel room with a few pieces of barely working equipment, but here they also decided to have the sauna in the same room. It was really hot and hard to work out at all. The positives are many. THe room was clean and bathroom was very nice. The hotel staff is multilingual, very accomodating and helpful when trying to figure out places to go. The location is prime. It is located right in the middle of the city so we were able to walk west and see palacio real and opera house, etc. and then the next day we went east and saw the prado and the riena sofia, etc. We walked to el retiro and plaza mayor. Also right around the corner from the hotel are many restaurants and bars. We had dinner at a fantastic place called the la gloria de las montanas. excellent food, not very expensive. We spent a late night out in plaza de santa ana also within walking distance. Just 2 blocks away is a metro stop which made getting to and from the airport quite easy. All in all it is a great location with nice people for around $100 a night.
UR5146791	We spent a week at the Gaudi which is ideally located for many of the major attractions - major art galleries, the palace and museums, and Atosha station are within easy walking distance for seniors. We found the staff helpful and friendly. The breakfasts were good with a wide assortment of fruit, cheese, cold meats, fried foods, cakes and bread and croissants baked on the premises. As one other person commented, some of the decor might be criticised but everywhere was clean and our room was really just for sleeping. We experienced no problems with the bathroom, which was in marble and had a nice powerful shower. We would return to this hotel were we to go back to Madrid.
UR5027295	It was a nice experience, clean hotel and central, the rooms are spacious, the breakfast is tasty. The only con I can find is that a couple of our group lost their wallets and passports when going together on having some buffet breakfast. They left their things at the table and didn´t find them on the way back. Of course, the hotel management doesn´t have any responsibility. Those people were careless maybe, but I didn´t feel so safe there after that. On the whole it is a hotel that I would reccomend to everybody and I would stay there again in the future.
UR4475209	We stayed here for 2 nights during January and overall we were very pleased with it. The location of the hotel is great, just on the main street of Madrid, within a walking distance to all major attractions. The hotel itself is small and not very new, but definitely adequate. The breakfast buffet was quite satisfactory, although the supply of tea and coffee was problematic during rush hours. Initially we were given a room which overlooks a wall and that was too claustrophobic for my husband so he asked for a better one. The recepcionist was understanding and gave us a much better room at an upper floor directly overseeing the busy main street. Sitting in front of the window and watching people go by at night was very nice. The size of the room and the bathroom was more than adequate. Overall, I can recommend this place.
UR4255629	This is a classic hotel, a good central location on the Gran Via in Madrid. My room had two single beds which were fairly comfortable and the bathroom is nice, with marble. Good shower with lots of hot water and good water pressure. The room was not as clean as I would have liked and I thought it could have been a little nicer to rank 4 stars. I've stayed in better 3 stars. But, if you get a promo price on this hotel like I did 77 Euro a night it is a good value and the location is excellent. The staff is helpful and courteous. The wireless internet is expensive, 9 Euro for 2 hours.
UR3941732	Went there for my "stag weekend" (bachelor party) in Madrid. Expecting a poor hotel but actually it was ok. Service was good. Location is great though bear in mind it is on the edge of Madrid's gay district. Rooms - pretty basic, but clean, modernish and tidy. Sizes and views from each room varied. Aim for a room on the 7th floor. They are somewhat larger with a sofa and coffee table with great views over the rooftops. Others in my group had rooms with small windows facing inwards into a shaft in the middle of the hotel building. Not so good but they did have a large shower. The TV in my room did not work - not a big deal - but would have been nice to have been able to watch the BBC news whilst resting after a big night out. One downside is that the hotel charge almost 4 euros a night for a key for the safe in the room. A bit cheeky to charge in a supposedly 4 star hotel. The corridors can be confusing to navigate (its a bit maze-like but you soon get used to it) and the lifts (elevators) can be tempremental - on more than 1 occasion I got fed up of being in the lift and having to get out as it would keep re-opening the doors and refuse to move. The bar is excellent value - 1 euro 80 for a coffee and a couple of euros for a beer. If you're on a budget, want to be close to the night time action and like good service you can't really ask for much more than this.
UR3744940	I've just returned from a weekend in Madrid (Aug 2005) and I'm absolutely satisfied with the Catalonia Hotel Gaudí. Hotel Gaudí it's a quality hotel (4 stars, it belongs to the Catalonia Chain), absolutely centrally located (on the Gran Via, just meters or in walking distance to Fuencarral, Alcalá, Sol...) but really quiet (even being in that 24h busy street) and with very good value for your money. The rooms are not very large (the bathroom it is), but are very comfortable. The hotel has a gym, a jacuzzi and other facilities. Oh! and the air conditioning is absolutley silent and quick, which is essencial in a city like Madrid in august! The only thing we missed is a own parking but there are five public ones on the surroundings. If you come by car and it's the first time you visit madrid maybe you prefer other location but if you know the city or you reach by bus, train or plane... the location is great! Also, the staff is very kind and usefull if you have a trouble: on the reception desk the staff is young and multilingual, the rooms are quickly cleaned (even if you leave the room at 12:30 and you return at 14:30... like us) and if you have any kind of problem they make everything they can asap. Just to finish: a great choice for your time in Madrid no matter if you visit Madrid as a tourist or by other reasons.
UR3536148	I spent a full week at this hotel and did little more than sleep and shower in it. The pros here are its location and friendly and helpful staff. All the major plazas and restaurants are walkable from here. If this is of key importance, then the following cons might be overlooked. The maids did not replace the bed with fresh sheets, they simply re-made the bed. We did receive fresh bathtowels. The bathroom had a lingering odor of cologne and sewage intertwined which was already present when we first walked into the room and remained until we checked out. (Keeping the bathroom door closed helped the situation a little) Although the air conditioning unit was whisper quiet, we could hear toilets flushing and showers running from the rooms above us through the pipes in the bathroom. This noise was very frequent. I spent no more than 10 minutes in the whirlpool area. The room was not inviting or relaxing in any way; it felt like a cellar. Half the jets in the pool did not work and the area in general was unkept. There was a sauna and some workout equipment there, but I cannot comment because I did not use them. Overall, my stay in Madrid was not effected negatively in any way by hotel Gaudi, but if you are going to spend a lot of time in the hotel room, look elsewhere. It is overpriced for what they have to offer.
UR3524067	Stayed at the hotel for 6 days. The room was average size with a nice size bathroom but the bathroom had a prevalent musty odor. It looked clean but you get a faint odor from the bathroom just from being in the room. The breakfast was not bad. I wouldn't consider trying out the jacuzzi because even though it was functioning while we were there, the room it was in was not at all relaxing (it was darkly lit with one flourescent light), and the area around it didn't look like it had been cleaned very well (saw bootprint marks around the jacuzzi). At least the hotel was in a good location and a lot of Madrid sights were within walking distance. The fridge and the AC turned on were very quiet and the room we stayed in didn't get very much street noise either so that was good. Overall, I would not go back to this hotel if I were to go back to Madrid.
UR125239232	We did not stay at this hotel, so I'm not able to talk about the room. But we did stop in the lobby and the woman working at the front desk was able to help us out tremendously. She was very accommodating and welcoming despite the fact that we weren't staying at the hotel. The antique decor is charming and the lobby was clean and comfortable. I would book a room at this hotel based only on the way that they treated us as non-guests and welcomed us into their space. Obviously very kind hearted and caring hosts.
UR122852140	I stayed here with my friends on our first visit to Napa Valley, and the receptionist was extremely helpful. The hotel is being renovated, and the rooms and bathrooms that have been renovated are really nice. We happened to stay in a room that had not been renovated, and spoke with the receptionist about some of our concerns and they apologized completely and gave us a partial refund, which was great and unexpected. I would recommend this as an affordable place to stay in St.Helena, with a great location.
UR120445404	This wasn't the best hotel we had stayed in during our CA trip but there were some good things about it that should be pointed out. Firstly it is in a great location for dining with two EXCELLENT restaurants just minutes walk away, one just opposite the hotel. This is what you need after a day of wine tasting; somewhere where you don't need to use the car. The gentille ladies who seem to own and run the place are pleasant and helpful and we saw no signs of the grubby carpets etc that some have complained about. Admittedly it was expensive - we paid around USD 120 for a room with shared bathrooms - all that was available - but the bathrooms were always clean and dry and no sign of others using them, although they must have. The breakfast was much better than most 'motel' style places in USA and the hotel had a calm and quiet air about it. howver, there was a fairly noisy aircon fan outside our window which we asked the landlady to turn off at night, which she did. otherwise we had no real complaints. If you are there to enjoy the hotel then choose another, but if you are in St Helena to enjoy the region and visit the wineries etc, this place could be ideal.
UR120310393	Very sparse accomodations for price. i made a mistake and thought I had 3 nights reservation but only had 2 nights. I was touring the valley with business partner when I received a call at about 3 PM indicating i had failed to checkout so everything was gathered from my room and put in a plastic bag behind the counter. Very unprofessional. Only good thing is I had to stay somewhere else that third night.
UR119310097	We made a reservation, and when we got to check in, the price was higher of what we had already paid with our credit card. The only thing the rude manager offered us was ''no charge for leaving and go get a hotel room somewhere esle'' at the last minute...
UR117680679	I was warned by previous reviewers but got desperate and stayed here anyway. For over $200 a night this was a serious disappointment. The room was tiny (I couldn't walk around the room after I opened my overnight bag), looked out onto a brick wall, paint was peeling in several spots, there was no night stand next to the bed and thus no lamp next to the bed, lighting from the ceiling lamp was inadequate to read, there was no TV or even a clock radio. I had to stand on the bed to turn on the ceiling fan and it was hot. Opening the window was not an option as the inadequate air conditioner was outside of the window and very loud. The carpet was old and I put towels on the floor for sanitary reasons. The bathroom was "down-the-hall" which I knew ahead of time. For this price, I would have expected a few more amenities especially for "down-the-hall" such as throw away slippers, paper cups in the bathroom, shower items. . . Breakfast consisted of pre-packaged bakery goods and beige coffee. This is a budget hotel with top pricing. And, yes, as other reviewers said, it has a weird feeling. I got up early and couldn't wait to get out. There is no elevator so be prepared to lug your bags up 2 flights of stairs. If it was a deal, I'd put up with the inconveniences but for the price - this hotel is ridiculous. Drive a little further and be more comfortable.
UR114790929	I travelled to St. Helena for a week long class at the Culinary Institute of America and stayed at the Hotel St. Helena. As I was checking in, the lady at the front desk mentioned that she would be on duty until 8:00 PM. Since I travelled from Orlando Florida, the first order of business was a nice long nap, followed by unpacking and dinner. When I got back to my room around 8:10, I turned on the TV and found that it did not work. Fortunately, the lady (owner?) at the front desk was still there, waiting for one last guest to arrive. She immediately moved me to a different room--one slightly larger and with a bigger bathroom (and a working TV!). I don't know what hotel some of the other reviewers stayed at, but it could not have been this one. I found Hotel St. Helena to be quaint, tasteful, and clean. I have a bad back, and as such at home sleep on a mattress only slightly softer than a slab of granite. But I suffered no ill effects at all from the hotel's mattress. I did not venture into the garden, but the upstairs common area proved to be the perfect place, if a little dark, to enjoy a glass of wine after a long hot day in the kitchens of CIA. I also cannot speak to the quality of the breakfast or afternoon tea as class coincided with both. The location cannot be beat. Right in the heart of downtown St. Helena, with numerous restaurants and all of the shopping within easy walking distance, again I'll mention the bad back. There were really few negatives, but if I had to nitpick, an ice machine in a common area, or better yet small fridge in the room, would have been nice. Also, if you are travelling with a laptop and your power brick has a three prong plug, then you might want to bring a short extension cord or buy one at the hardware store just up the street as the only three prong outlet is in the bathroom. All in all, I would happily stay at Hotel St. Helena again.
UR114124794	My daughter and I took a road trip to Napa and stayed 2 nights at the St. Helena Hotel. The service we received was great. The hotel is charming with a little touch of rustic. The continental breakfast was perfect for our needs. The outdoor sitting/garden area is adorable. We'll certainly be back because there's no better value for the location.
UR104551117	I booked the Hotel St Helena after looking at it's website. My first clue should have been the 'NO REFUNDS' sign at the reception desk. This hotel was reasonably clean, with old carpeting. Decor is always personal choice --- if you like collections of old dolls and knick knacks, this is the place for you. Our room was small, spartan and stuffy. We had to put our bags on the floor. There was no room on the nightstand between the beds. A wobbly armoire offered a couple of wire clothes hangers. No hooks for coats, no hooks in the bathroom. The beds were so soft when I sat in the middle both ends came up. There were no mattress pads --- just the sheet. We got into bed, realized our heads were low & feet were high, so we put our pillows at the other end. Can't report on the continental breakfast -- we got up and out of there. (the highpoint was a late dinnet at Cindy's Backstreet Cafe --excellent!)
UR101004973	I can't imagine why anyone would give this place a rating above zero. Its that bad. The maroon carpets are badly stained. The bathroom barely works. The street noise is loud, and you can't open the room windows. How can it be louder inside my room than outside? The television was a joke -- something from the 1970's? All fuzzy with terrible reception. To read, I could prop myself in the little chair and put my feet up on the bed -- cozy -- no. The bedspread smelled terribly like some man's cologne. I threw the pillows on the floor and used my own travel pillow. The room's pillows looked like the ones I would throw out after my son came home from three weeks in summer camp. Gross. The breakfast was a sad affair. Don't believe the reviews about a "French" breakfast or whatever that is. Think reconstituted orange juice and a piece of flimsy raisin toast with a vat of recycled cream cheese on the side. Wine reception? Be careful of the glasses -- mine had a crack all the way up to its opening. Kind of speaks for the entire place. Oh, and re the haunted nature of many reviews -- there is no doubt this place has a creepy aura -- nothing bad happened to me there (except a guy walking out of my room when I was gone for 5 minutes -- is that creepy?), but there's no way I would ever set my foot (or wallet) back in that overpriced dump.
UR94055888	I recently tried to stay at the Hotel St. Helena. I was enroute when, at 3 p.m., I received a phone call asking if I was coming. When I said yes, they asked when I would get there because, if I got there after 5p.m. I would find a key under the mat. And, at 5:15, that's what I found. I then went upstairs to a nicely appointed, old-fashioned hotel--at least until I got to the room. The room was like a monk's cell. Cold, no closet ( I was there for a sewing workshop so I had nice garments needing hanging), a mini TV 3/4 of the way up the wall (like in a hospital) and no dresser to put garments in! Weird! But weirder still was, after going for a walk, grabbing a bite to eat and coming back around eight, there was still not a soul in the hotel. It was still dark and cold and there was this slamming noise which sounded like a large door but, since there were no voices or footsteps following the slam, I figured it must be a central heating system. My room was still cold and frankly, I was creeped out. There was no wine as promised, no check in till 6 p.m and the number they left, if I needed anything, was the answering service. I know because that's the number I called to let them know I was leaving and, since I hadn't used anything but the toilet down the hall, would not want to be charged. I got a call the next day at 3, telling me I would be charged for that night, even though I drove to Calistoga and stayed at a more expensive hotel! They said there was a 72 hour cancellation policy. I never even received a confirmation letter saying this but, it is on their website--along with their promises of wine, check-in times, etc. However, since I did show but, couldn't stay, I don't see how relevant that policy would be, anyway. They best part is, today I read the review"Is this hotel haunted, or what?" which made me really glad of my choice to leave! This hotel should not be in business!
UR86176985	Unexpectedly found this gem and was suprised beyond our imagination. If you want charming, this is it. This was the highlight of our honeymoorn; the location, the service, the quaintness, the breakfast, the atmosphere. Couldn't believe the price given the location. We slept with the windows open and although you could hear some traffic it was still peaceful. You can walk to all of the great shops and any of the incredible restaurants. Dozens of great wineries within 10 minutes. We will stay here again and recommend this to anyone who is considering a trip to Napa.
UR79432592	What a charming European style Hotel with allot of character. The staff was friendly and very helpful. I found the hotel to be very clean and certainly not haunted (dispite other comments). On my next travel to St Helena I will make my reservations again at this charming Hotel.
UR78974416	This hotel was truly an amazing place to stay, I really enjoyed the beautiful rooms the free breakfast and wine and it's close proximity to fabulous stores and restaurants. The rooms were spotless and the staff was very helpful with anything you might ask. This was the best priced hotel than any other i've stayed at in al long time. A Fabulous Getaway and a must see!
UR78672312	The hotel is nice and very clean as same as the rooms but the pillows and the comfort set O MY GOD they smell really really bad, I have to sleep with no pillow for that night other thing is that is totally overpriced, i will never but never in my life stay there again . DONT STAY AT ST. HELENA HOTEL
UR74221299	I simply had a spectacular experiance, a never before known about Victorian hotel caught me by surprise like nothing I've ever stayed at before. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and it has the best location out of ANY other hotel in st. Helena.
UR73336665	My husband and I (along with daughter and boyfriend in a separate room) stayed in this hotel for one night following the wedding of a friend. Location smack dab on the main street of St. Helena meant it was easy to find, in the middle of all the wine country action. Hotel staff was very nice and hotel itself was funky but charming - rather on an old European scale. Rooms were definitely small but both rooms and bathrooms were clean. Towels were fluffy, not the threadbare things you can get in some hotels. Rooms were on the expensive side BUT (and this is a big but) there was no two-night minimum even in the middle of summer. A big plus! There was a small complementary wine bar in the evening and a continental breakfast in the AM. It was perfect for an overnight stay when all we really needed was a place to change into our wedding finery and then lay our heads at night. I don't think I would have enjoyed it half as much if I had planned to center my weekend around a luxurious hotel stay.
UR72508128	We were 3 couples on the second floor, rooms 205 - 207 and stayed there for two nights on a weekend. The rate of USD 220 (incl. taxes) is totally overpriced. There were two shared bathrooms for 4 rooms. Very small rooms, our two suitcases did not fit in there. Bed was very soft and small. Cleaning service did not replace towels. It was also loud (could hear the sound of the bar around the corner). Location is good and breakfast was ok, Free parking was also available. Rates for a weekday are more reasonable, but I would definitely not go back there anyway.
UR68872125	I spent the night last night with my best friend after a wedding at one of the winery's. We shared a room and got back at about midnight. At 3:00 am, my friends daughter called and needed a place to crash and ask if she could stay in the room with us. My friend got out of bed and opened the front door said "what the hell is a doll doing in the hall way?? I got up and saw and that each door including ours had a creapy vintage hierloom dall facing each door and no one was around. I told her to go pick up her daughter and I'm locking the door. When she came back about 20 min later, her daughter freeked out because they were everywhere, even sitting on top of the staircase. I took a few pictures on my I-phone and went back to bed. The next morning they were gone and the old man at the front desk didn't know anything about it. He said the owner of the hotel collected dolls and that they are kept on display in locked glass display cases. Another man ovheard my friend asking the old man about the dolls said that he saw them too. The old man was adiment that he knew nothing of it, but he has heard that the hotel was haunted. Was this a prank, or maybe the old lady that owned the hotel is so proud of her doll collection that she wan't people to see them.. It was pretty creapy and I still have the pics. The old man said only two people have keys to the display cases, but only one was working that night and she went home at 10:00.
UR65437039	I went wine tasting with four friends and we needed a place to stay for one night and was seduced by the hotel's great location on the main street in St. Helena. I can honestly say that its location is the hotel's only redeeming feature. For $275 on a Saturday night here is what you get. (1) The opportunity to cart your bags up a creaky set of stairs; (2) A choice of room that at best was last redone in the 1930s and at worst has a slanted floor; and (3) bathrooms that have bathtubs (no stall showers) or broken hardware; There is charming and there is dumpy. The line is rarely thin--certainly not here.
UR60870239	This was truly a lovely experiance. I reall enjoyed staying at the hoyltel because of it's victorian charm which I you just do not find at all. It had a French little breakfast that came with the room fee. I also beleive that they have done some recent renovations.
UR51192325	I pulled up to this charming lil hotel with my fiancÃ©.. We were out wine tasting for the day and we decided to pull in for the night. As I stepped in the door I felt like I was entering a new era.. Beatiful antique and Victorian styles and for those of u doll lovers.... It's paradise.. The rooms were petit but it gave me a perfect chance to snuggle up with my lover.. Ahh and what a night that was :). I arose in the morning and went down for breakfest... Wonderful continental breakfast
UR30472220	The review on this one all depends on your personal preferences and, well, tolerances. We knew the rooms would be small. But I can't remember staying in a smaller room ... even in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada (they only had a single bed in the rooms!) or in Paris, which is known for tight rooms. Yes there was TV ... a 12 inch model. And a tiny, ancient , beat up dresser (or is it antique? - depends on your tastes). The whole place is old, old, old. Bathroom had a shower but was ... well ... compact. Staff are friendly. And if you're into antique dolls there's a collection on display. But, this has to be one of our more "unique" hotel experiences. Continental breakfast was OK but very limited. And we were served some 'anonymous' red wine (we're in Napa, remember) the evening of our stay. Kudos to them for recommending the Rutherford Grill in nearby Rutherford for a terrific lunch! I wouldn't recommend the St Helena Hotel to a friend unless I knew they shared our "appreciation" of the unique. Expected a stagecoach to pull up out front!
UR20520183	The hotel is in too good a location. Main street and Highway 29 are one and the same. This unfortunately translated into nonstop traffic which is easily heard in your room. Another problem is the bar down the street, playing loud music late at night making it close to impossible to sleep. If you are interested in a good nights sleep, look elsewhere or use earplugs.
UR16804697	Rooms are so small they are a joke. Door to bedroom doesn't even open all of the way, as it bumps into the bed. Bathroom door doesn't open all the way as it bumps into the toilet. 2 people and one gym bag barely fit in the room. You have to balance your purse, toiletries, clothes, etc on edges of sink, bed. Room was right on the street. We could hear conversations, car noises, etc. Pillows were tiny, the 2 that they give you barely are big enough for your head and were flat,discolored and uncomfortable. The mattress left a lot to be desired. Hotel rooms have no A/C. Very, very dated. It is really too bad, because of the location, they could have a killer hotel if they updated, cleaned and upgraded. Come on, even at $200 a night you expect something more than this! We drove home.
UR12855949	Not sure if it was good or bad luck that the Hotel St. Helena had drop in rooms available. Location is great, staff is nice, but rooms are really dated. Don't stay on a Sunday evening, garbage pickup starts around 5am. Bad back - don't do it - Really. Room was clean but really tired. Limited hot water. If you have another alternative, I recommend to stay somewhere else.
UR10501879	We turned up at this hotel without a reservation and chose it purely because of its closeness to Beringer winery. It is a quirky, Victorian-style hotel, full of character (and dolls). Our room had a huge bed, huge wardrobe and huge bathroom but everything was a bit tatty and tired, with a few repairs that looked long overdue. The worst thing was the fact that it is on a busy main road and noisy traffic passes all night. There is no double glazing. Breakfast was included and was very good with plenty of choice and we thought the prices were reasonable. If you like modern, bland, hotels with everything perfect, this is not for you. But if, like us, you like something with a bit of character, give it a try!
UR8655493	The best thing about this hotel is the location and that's it. I stayed four nights. This hotel has plumbing problems. Showers are funky design with loose/broken parts. Rooms are small, but decor is really o.k. It also is NOT well/professionally managed. These people are NOT on top of things. They also need a new cleaning staff. The baths felt kind of dirty. I had to move to a second room after the first night. The breakfast is nothing really. But it is something. You can go to the little gourmet market which I did and get breakfast if you get there between 7:30-8:00am before it is sold out. Nice market. Has organic apples etc. Just know this before booking. You can walk to most restaurants and they are nice ones. There is parking as well for your car. But this time when I tried to call, no one ever answered the phone. Bed is not bad either. I paid $100/night with tax.
UR5809891	We drove up, without a reservation, looked at the room..."supposedly" redone...and decided to use it as a base of operations while in the area. Showers were next to useless...no hot water in one room and very low pressure in our 2nd room...they warned about all pipes for disposing of items...understood, but not the otherway around...There was no compassion by the morning manager other than "Sorry". She would tell the Manager, plumber etc... Breakfast is ok..nothing fancy... The beds were hard, the headboard great if you were a prisoner in a cell and had indenetations in your head... But overall, it was acceptable for what we were looking for.. No wireless internet...free or other wise.
UR3542849	My Mom and I recently stayed at the Hotel St. Helena. Staff were very nice and the location of the hotel was ideal. However, I would never recommend this hotel. We were put in the Champagne Room, it was very small and there was barely enough room for the two of us and our luggage. The two single beds were awful, my back was completely out after spending one night in them. The shower is more like a gentle rain coming down and I was unable to get the soap out of my hair. When we looked at hotels, this hotel was not the cheapest but chose it because of location, sadly its totally not worth the price or location.
UR3250240	My husband and I stayed here during a spur-of-the-moment overnight trip to St. Helena. The staff was friendly, efficient, and willing to give dining and regional activity recommendations. The location is great if you like to spend time shopping and dining on the main drag in St. Helena. And the off-season rates are really reasonable; the hotel included parking for the length of our stay in the room rate. I second the previous reviewer's comments about the doll and puppet fetish -- they're everywhere! The room was clean, with a spacious bathroom, an antique wardrobe with hangers, and a nice selection of Yardley toiletries. The one downside for us was the comfort of our bed. We stayed in the Merlot room, and the sheets were scratchy. By morning, we also felt like the mattress springs had imprinted on our backsides. To make matters worse, a brass headboard was propped up behind the mattress, but it wasn't actually attached to the frame, so the slightest movement in the night resulted in the headboard knocking against the wall. Needless to say, I ended up coming home and taking a 2-hour nap to compensate for the lack of sleep the night before. Before accepting the room that they give you when you check in, I would definitely do a quick examination of the bed to see if it's going to yield a good night's sleep.
UR128379619	We spent our 'mini-moon' at the hotel El Palace and had a wonderful 4 night stay. The hotel interiors are very grand and ornate yet have a very 'new' and fresh feel. Our room, on the 5th floor was very quiet, clean and well decorated. The bathroom was beautiful, a small bath, seperate shower cubicle with rainfall shower and hand held attachment (ideal if you do not wish to get your hair wet every time you shower) and a WC with its own door. The bed was very comfortable although it was 2 beds pushed together to form a super king - a pet hate of mine. Rooms do not come with an iron or ironing board. There is an ironing service offered at a (high) charge but we phoned down to reception and they brought both within 5 minutes of our call. Room keys are of the old style with an enormous tassle on. This is presumably to encourage you to hand in the key to the concierge before leaving the hotel. This was no problem for us and we never had to wait for our key even when arriving back to the hotel after midnight. The concierge was very helpful for us, booking restaurants and giving recommendations, they also helped us get FC Barcelona tickets before we arrived. We did not eat in the hotel and there really was no need. The Palace is situated near a plethora of cafes, tapas bars and restaurants. We were a 10 minute stroll from the nearest metro or Placa de la Catyluna and the start of Las Ramblas. We could not have picked a better location. We had a fab stay in Barcelona and a lot of that was down to our choice of hotel. After a hectic day walking the streets of the gothic quarter and las ramblas it was lovely to come back to a calm, quiet hotel for some rest and relaxation.
UR128281783	The hotel has clearly had a lot of TLC on it. They have kept the traditional feel but at the sametime our room was modern and very up to date. We stayed in a Junior Suite (423). Having travelled with hand luggage only the toliteries are very welcome, including a wet razor. We were shown to our room which had a welcome plate of fruit and a bottle of water. Only observation here, is that the water was not replaced and the fruit plate was removed before everything was eaten. The hotel is ideally located for exploring Barcelona but I receommend a room at the rear, although we had air conditioning it was nice to open the windows. I did think the description of overlooking a traditional courtyard was a bit of a stretch but it depends on what you consider a traditional courtyard. Staff could not do enough for you and the Cocktail bar is like stepping back in time to a 1930's era. Cocktails range from €12 - €18. We did not eat at the hotel as we like to find somewhere where the locals eat. As any City the tourist areas rip you off in charges. The fitness room is free but there are charges for the Spa. Cannot comment on these as we did not use them. Also I do think that in this day and age Wi-Fi should be free. Would we stay at the hotel again - YES!
UR128156417	The hotel has recently been refurbished an looks really nice. It is however let down by 3 flaws. Firstly there is no in room wifi, which means that if you have an iPad you have to go down to the foyer and get a pass code to access the web for just 1 hour whilst sitting in the entrance hall. This is annoying and becomes tedious after a couple of days. Secondly the Metro trains clearly run under the hotel and their noise is significant and the fact that they start up at 5am means getting a good night's sleep is difficult. This is compounded by the third issue which is that the room doors almost slam shut meaning that once the first person exits their room in the morning, everyone on that floor is woken. A real shame because it is not a cheap hotel and could have been very nice indeed.
UR128132843	Our five-day vacation stay at this well-located hotel was largely pleasant, mostly due to the very professional and helpful staff. The large opulent lobby area impresses with old-style luxury hotel atmosphere and plenty of comfy sofas, while the rooms are nice but not particularly special as compared to other five-star hotel rooms. The room seemed smaller than indicated which probably reflects including in the advertised size, the "dead" space hallway leading into the room and the large bath area, which included both a shower and a regular bathtub. The shower only had a tiny plastic soap dish to hold the soap, shampoo, conditioner - not to mention my face wash, razor, shaving lotion - so some things had to be put on the shower floor and other things kept falling off the tiny dish. I guess this is a typical design with no function issue. The smallish working desk didn't have a desk lamp; the only lighting being ceiling downlights that could only all be turned on at once, making it difficult for one person to work at the desk while the other went to bed earlier or got up later. After I requested a desk lamp, the hotel did put one in. Ask for one when you check-in to avoid loss of sleep and irritation!. More irritating is that this pricey hotel charges for in-room wifi (15 Euro per day) while offering a cable-internet connection in the room. When paying over 400 Euro a day for a smallish room, I expect to get the wifi free. I also disliked the bedding, this must be the first 5-star hotel I have stayed in that does not have high-quality sheets and duvets. The sheets felt and looked basic, no choice of pillows, and worst of all, there was only a thin brown blanket(doesn't feel "fresh" or comfy) stretched across the king-size bed. Perhaps I am spoiled (I spend about 75 hotel nights a year in 4 or 5 star hotels), but I like a down or feather duvet - one for each side of the bed but big enough to share. Surprisingly there were only 2 bath towels and 2 hand towels in the room - no wash cloth and no extra bath towel for drying hair (we were two in the room). The towels were standard size and rather worn: thin and even fraying on the edges. The closet and clothing storage area is located in the bath area, which some may find less convenient. The armchair in our room was soiled from use (brownish discoloration on the arm rests and the front of the seat area), making it unattractive to sit on. The breakfast cost 28 Euro per person, and was pretty standard fare. I would have liked more fruits - I was disappointed there were no berries (all over Europe there are Spanish strawberries sold cheaply now). The breakfast room is a canvas covered outdoor garden and a bit cold. One morning we were put by the door to the patio where smokers go and it was very cold with the door frequently opening (and often being left open). I was surprised that when we sat in the lobby, no one ever came up and asked if we would like to order some coffee or a drink (a couple of times we sat for 20 - 30 minutes and staff would merely walk by, even though the lobby was nearly empty). But when I tracked down the bartender and ordered tea, it was very nicely served. The location of the hotel is good. Barcelona boasts many high-end and other hotels may offer more real luxury for the price. If you want heavy drapes, lots of gold and gild, embossed wall-paper, and "old-world luxury", this hotel may suit you. If so, ask for a high-floor room (only 6 floors) to avoid traffic noise, (you can still hear the subway rumble if the room is quiet and you're not distracted. This did not bother us but might a light sleeper.)
UR127819696	We stayed at the El Palace Hotel in March 2012. The hotel was wonderful from the doorman to front desk to the concierge to the restaurant and bar staff. Our room was spacious, well appointed, and in almost new condition. We only stayed one night, a stopover to catch a cruise out of Barcelona, and wish we'd had more time to explore the city and take advantage of a great hotel.
UR127795342	If you like opulent interiors with silk and velvet drapes, cozy beautiful furniture of the last centuries combined with technology and convenience of the modern civilization than El Palace hotel in Barcelona will impress you. Contemporary big bathrooms with a separate toilet, with cascade shower for those who like being washed by the rain, or a more traditional (the boring one) as well. The lavish rooms are big, equipped with Mirror/TV and fireplace, and very, very quite thanks to the little hallway separating the entry and the room itself by a door. The beds are very comfortable. We had our breakfast in a garden area of the hotel. So delicious and the verity is of great restaurants. Don't forget to enjoy the Rein de Rein lounge downstairs where local jazz bands often perform. Special thanks to Javier, who was so helpfull not only with our luggage, but with other things, like recommendations and letting us feel very welcome and taken care of. Next time i'm in Barcelona, El Palace is my home.
UR127792754	Our family holiday started in Barcelona. We arrived early, as usual, normal check in time was 3pm. I asked for 1 room for my elderly parents, they accommodated my request and found a room. All the staff were very courteous and assisted in finding us restaurants and attractions. The buffet breakfast is excellent. The rooms were quite spacious, the facilities have been renovated. The location is close to Catalunya Square, easy walking distance to La Rambla. Definitely will come back.
UR127790880	This hotel is completely centrally located. The staff is top notch. Francisco at the Concierge station got us front row tix to a Catalan guitar concert in the Music Hall, an expert guide for a walking tour of the sites, the best restaurant recommendations, etc. Room service was at the door minutes after calling. The entire place was completely restored just 2 years ago and simply looks like the 1919 Ritz but brand new.
UR127484220	I tried The Palace Hotel for the first time last month, it was a great experience. My first stay here was back when it was a Ritz but the new name also comes with new rooms, menu, and a complete remodel but keeping the classic feel to the property. Food at the bar is very good, service overall excellent. I should mention that we found out about a general city strike during our stay and asked the front desk to change our checkout date for a day earlier, was told a charge for the non used night was going to apply, I asked for no charge on this and was told no, not happy but I understood it was their right to do so, so no hard feelings there. HOWEVER, two minutes after I hung up, the person at front desk called and informed me that there was not going to be a charge. It was their option and took the side of the customer. Do not miss the ham and tomato bread, had it 5 times during our stay and would take home if they let me.
UR127453819	This hotel has spoiled me for any other break! The furnishings are very opulent and traditional yet it's bang up to date with the bathroom, TV in the mirror and so on. We stayed as a family in the classic room with our fifteen year old daughter and she loved it, although there was a slight problem with the lights flickering and she thought it seemed like the Hollywood Tower of Terror (Disney) hotel! The position was great for getting around on foot to see all of the sights and, after reading recommendations on this site about asking for a higher room, we found it very peaceful and quiet when we needed to recharge our batteries! That said, I never noticed any "rumbling" from the underground even when we were on the ground floor. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed for our four day trip, 2-6th April, due to holidays but we asked for recommendations from concierge and they were great! The staff were all helpful and friendly and I'd definitely love to return but I'd hope for less rain next time! A lovely break and it would be great to stay here again.
UR127413742	Beautifully decorated and elegant hotel. The lounge is spectacular. The staff was exceptionally helpful and courteous in planning our excursions. The location is superb for walking to shopping and restaurants. Prices in the bars/lounges are quite high, but that is to be expected at a Ritz. There is a sports bar across the street that is a great place when Barcelona Soccer is playing (especially if they win.) If you have the "loot," it is a terrific place to stay in Barcelona.
UR127142257	We stayed at the El Palace for four nights during our recent visit to Barcelona. It was an incredible stay. The location is really perfect for exploring Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotic, and L'Eixample. Walking into the hotel, it really feels like you are walking back in time with old-fashioned service and a beautiful lobby area. Also, make sure to eat at the Hotel Restaurant, Caelis. They definitely deserve their Michelin Star. All in all, a great experience!!
UR126729612	We would definetly stay again. Advantages: - Excellent location - Wonderful kids amenities (they provided everything we needed and presented our boy a toy which he loved) - Excellent breakfast - Wonderful friendly and helpful staff - I liked the style of decoration, very gorgeous Areas of improvement: - No free wifi in rooms Note: To park the car with special prices you should ask the help of the porter
UR126501237	After staying at a bunch of hotels in Barcelona, El Palace combine the charm of old world luxury with re-done rooms, VERY friendly staff right in the middle of Barcelona. Had brunch at hotel, which was very nice in the garden. Room was very comfortable and clean. I would stay there again.
UR126265873	We chose this hotel through a Thomas Cook Flexible trip brochure and on recommendation from an experienced travel consultant at a local Thomas Cook travel agency. It was to celebrate a fiftieth birthday with a week’s stay in a luxury five star hotel. The break was to be a surprise for my partner, but the cat was let out of the bag, when Thomas Cook sent through marked envelopes in the post with their name on the outside. Our destination was the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona flying with Easyjet with a private taxi transfer to our hotel. We got caught up in the bag fiasco at Gatwick airport (power outage on the conveyor belt), but luckily our baggage was transferred without any delay to our destination. We found the El Palace Hotel in Barcelona a very luxurious hotel with the following excellent points: - 1. Excellent customer service 2. Excellent accommodation 3. Excellent food 4. Excellent location 5. Friendly and helpful staff The only downside we had a very slow draining bathroom sink after a few days which was not rectified on our first mention of it. It was rectified on the second mention. The prices for hotel extras we found to be a little on the expensive side, but for a five star hotel I suppose this is to be expected. Overall prices for most items in Barcelona were expensive in comparison to the UK. If a quiet stay is required, then this is not the right hotel, as it is located on one the main roads into Barcelona. We found our room to be well insulated from the traffic noise though, and we slept soundly on very comfortable beds. The hotel staff assisted us with excellent service in re-arranging our pick up time on our return journey back to the UK, as this was booked for 5:45am in the morning for a 10:55 flight back to the UK. We did ask the staff at our local Thomas Cook agency to change this, but did not find them very helpful in accommodating this. Overall our stay was very enjoyable and we would not hesitate in returning to this hotel again.
UR125751795	Fab hotel, great location. Defiantly has the wow factor as soon as you walk through the door. Service impeccable. Breakfast is served in a heated garden room and is the best buffet breakfast I have ever had. It was my first romantic weekend away with my new boyfriend and it was a dream. Highly recommend it. Shopping in Barca is great to and just outside your door. Head to the markets for the most amazing colours and vibrancy. Enjoy x
UR125577900	The hotel is perfectly located for sightseeing. This beautiful old hotel is very focused on good service and there was always a member of staff to cater for every reqirement. The breakfast was 30 euros but all visitors receive a 50 euros voucher for the restaurants so we used it on breakfast and we were not disappointed. The food and garden room setting were a highlight of our stay. The classic room was large and totally adequate. If you prefer to use the bath please note it is small.
UR125540216	I stayed the night of 29th of feb at el palace barcelona, this hotel is one of the ritz building this genius has created ! Now it has been revamp with full new deco and works My room 407 was great ! The deco is very tradi but comfort and fully equiped! The extra the bathroom, former roman bath that make you feel like cesar !!! The l occitane products were great and finally one hotel which offers real quality products !!!! And hand crean toooo !!! The bfst lounge is in a patio so you can enjoy the morning freshness surrounding by trees buffet is awesome, staff is always keen to help ! I higly rec this place !!! Weel done to the hotel !!!
UR125492734	In my arrival the doormen were very attentive, helping with the luggage and took great pains to open the door before I entered. The lobby is so beautiful, a classical palace with beautiful pillars and a mix of light and dark hues. Once in reception, too many people to check-in. The first impression is that that’s an understaffing hotel. A negative feature that is just annoying - 15 minutes to check in. Location - It´s close to the city center, and a metro station is nearby. 10 minutes away from Las Rambla. Rooms - The management really should close some of them and use for storage or stock rooms. I was on the second floor and had to change it just minutes after I arrived. In the fifth floor I didn’t notice anything. If you keep your noisy room for all the days, your value of this hotel will be 1/5, instead the 4/5 it can achieve. Staff – so friendly and pleasure in general, but some of them need training in the luxury service, like the man who took my bags up and receiving no tip (not deserved) slammed the door and frowning when he saw me in the lobby. So rude. Restaurants – one Michelin star Caellis is brilliant. Don't lose the opportunity to taste this delicious restaurant. The second restaurant is simply part of an open living room, not very suggestive. Not feel like going. Breakfast is served in a lovely setting, the food offered is ok but not worth the money. Gym – Really poor. One of the the worst areas in the hotel. 3 machines and one of them out of service. It could be a great hotel if taking care of some points but meanwhile that’s a correct, nice and comfortable hotel far from the top notch rate.
UR125277056	Great Hotel, very good customer service The Hotel is in Great location 5 Min to Plaça de Catalunya
UR125099353	My husband and I just returned from a fabulous stay at El Palace. What a wonderful luxury hotel in the heart of Barcelona! I loved the hotel's location, which is accessible to all the major areas, eg, The Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia shopping, Gaudi's La Casa Mila,etc. Our room was elegant, yet comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and had every amenity including heated towels, a fabulous rain shower, sunken bathtub and bath products from L'Occitane. Also, I am a very sensitive sleeper and was pleased that I enjoyed 10 peaceful nights at the hotel. In addition, the staff at El Palace is incredible. From Mariano in reception, to Eloi, our bellman and all of the concierge staff - Xavier, Francisco, Alexis, Alex, Michael, we were treated like royalty! Their insight, knowledge, professionalism and advice really made our trip so memorable.
UR125019836	The El Palace is situated on a very busy main through route - the Gran Via de Corts Catalans. We were concerned that it may be noisy from the road as our room overlooked it but the sound proofing was adequate. The location is good for access to the City and is 15 mins away from Sagrada Familia in the other direction. The service in the hotel is excellent but beware of the prices in the bars, mini bars and spa. We included breakfast in our price but at €28 each if we hadn't it would have been more than we would have wanted to pay. However if cava and smoked salmon are what you want for breakfast then that price may be about right. We dined out every evening so are unable to comment on the quality of the food. There were not may eating in the restaurant so we wanted places where there was more atmosphere. In the busier summer months it may of course be rather different. We had a great week in Barcelona and we enjoyed our experience and stay at El Palace.
UR124584313	My husband and I just spent 5 fabulous nights at El Palace. We were greeted with a wonderful aroma in the lobby to wonderful service. Our room and bathroom were very spacious. The location in Barcelona was absolutely perfect. The concierge Alex, Katherina and Celine with guest relations were so helpful with travel tips and restaurant recommendations. We would recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona. We can't wait to come back. Thank you everyone at El Palace Hotel.
UR124567349	I can't believe it took me this long to write this review of El Palace, because the memory of it has stayed with me in a wonderful way. From arrival with elegantly dressed doormen who scooped up our luggage and delivered it quickly to the room, to the always helpful and charming concierge desk, to the waiters in the restaurant, everyone at El Palace aimed to serve and please. Our room overlooked the main street, so I was worried about noise. Nothing to worry about, and we were only about 3 floors up. In fact, I spent time out on our balcony looking at the passersby, and the architecture of this grand city. We had a beautiful marble bathroom, and two comfortable beds with plenty of room and pillows. Closet space was excellent. A writing desk to capture our memories at the end of the day. The decor is opulent and grand throughout the lobby, with many places to sit and start conversation. Despite the large, open space, it gives off an intimate feel. I used the hotel computers, stationed adjacent to the lobby, which were high speed and practical. The formal dining room looked nice, though we didn't eat there since we wanted to spend our money eating out in the many amazing city restaurants. The breakfast and lunch terrace was nicely decorated and almost felt like you were eating outdoors. My only complaint was the price for the food. Breakfast was very expensive. Thank goodness it tasted good. The location of the hotel is excellent. Close to metros.. a couple blocks from bustling Passeig de Gracia which hosts major shopping, terrific restaurants and the extraordinary Gaudi Casa Batllo mansion. You are maybe a 10-minute walk away from the top of Las Ramblas, and will cross a large, open square getting there, in which you will see everyone from performers to people walking to work. It was an incredible week.. and I loved calling El Palace home in Barcelona. We will return!
UR124455325	We stayed here for a few days before our cruise. It is a lovely hotel, and the location is excellent too. The only thing I can fault is the beds. They were too firm for our family. We had two rooms, and each of the rooms had a nice sitting area with a fireplace. The breakfast was wonderful too, and we enjoyed meeting every evening in the comfortable hotel bar. If you don't mind a rather hard bed, this is a good choice for Barcelona.
UR124388327	We spent two nights at this palace last month. What a luxurious hotel!!! Very well located, just a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas. The staff were helpful and very friendly. We were upgraded to a junior suite (honeymoon trip), elegant and spacious. They even gave us a bottle of Champagne, excellent detail.
UR124210141	My husband and I are spending our last night at this beautiful hotel tonight and want to complement the entire staff and premises. Celine, the manager, sought us out to introduce herself to us, and has been extremely courteous and friendly. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which is most comfortable. The recent renovations still give it the "old world charm" that we enjoy. We also visited several other hotels while here, and realize that this one is superior!
UR124139893	RoomService - Bad. Nobody speak English they will bring you something else. Not too much to order. Old personal rusty without energy Breakfast - poor. Totally disappointing. Room - junior suite with window in interior yard. No coffee or tea maker in Room 200 ml free still water in Room only for two person No weight scale in bathroom Coffee Expresso in bar is like American Cofee hotel is very clean , beautiful classical style looking very luxurious just they should fix some of minuses
UR123083034	We stayed at El Palace for a week in January and found this to be a luxurious hotel in a great location. The rooms were very spacious and the beds were exceptionally comfortable. We even had a huge walk in closet. I am so pleased that we chose this hotel over other options. The staff were friendly, helpful and quick to respond to our needs. My husband advised the hotel that we were celebrating my 60th birthday and retirement and on our arrival were given a complimentary bottle of champagne. When we return to Barcelona, we will definitley stay here again!
UR123057952	Only a few minutes walk form the main shopping street of Las Ramblas, this hotel shouldn't be described a hotel, it's more like stepping into a palace. We had a long 13 hour flight and all we wanted was to get to the hotel and do a bit of sightseeing. When we stepped in, your were greeted by a glistening chandelier, accompanied by two guards. The lounge was draped with green and purple hues and was the main highlight of the hotel. We actually got upgraded and we got a fabulous room. The room itself was elegant and very spacious with an oversized bath and rain shower. A definite choice in the heart of Barcelona!
UR123013287	This hotel is just superb, the decor and the staff are fantastic. The only snobbish chap was one on reception on the 7th Jan, the day of arrival who refused to accept our bed and breakfast booking because it was from some inferior travel-agent!! Apart from that we had a superb stay with breakfast not quite the 5 star rating.
UR122816047	We loved this hotel actually but we found it just a block or two too out of the main area. It was all within walking distance but after a long day, two blocks felt like more then that. I would stay here again but be more prepared for the location. There were always taxis outside and we got around ok.
UR122786626	I posted my review previously, I was looking to find any similar smell that this hotel uses and I just found in Wal Mart this perfume (Paul Sebastian), almost the same smell El Palace uses in their rooms & facilities. :)
UR122781236	Me, my wife and my parentes stayed @ El Palace during a car trip across Spain, France and Andorra. We stayed here in oct/11. The hotel is just amazing, from the smell until the restaurants. We stayed here for 4 nights and had a pleasant time. They offer all you can expect from a member of the leading hotels of the world, from location to comfort, from service to good drinks. The breakfast, asked at the room is very good, with different kind of breads, cheeses and ham, but the breakfast at the saloon was amazing. The saloon was beautiful, with plenty space between the tables. They have everything you need and much, much more. The room was just great, we had a suite with sofa and a large bathroom, but with view to the internal patio. The Bed was nice and large with a big screen tv and complimentary fresh fruits and spanish sparkling wine. The bathroom was great, with plenty space, separate large rain shower and tub and separate toilet as well. We tried the restaurant at the end of the lobby, at the main bar and the food was great, from the salad to pasta, everything very good and after the dinner we went to the downstairs bar and find a very nice small bar with a live pocket show where we had some good drinks with good music. The only point is that sometimes you can listening the subway from some areas of the hotel, but nothing that will make your stay less pleasant.
UR122594510	We booked a de-luxe double for 5 nights arriving on Christmas Day having been collected from the airport by the hotel car. On arrival we were upgraded to a 1st floor suite with an aspect looking out directly to rooms on the opposit site of former courtyard. To enable privacy, the windows were at least 80% opaque glass and with 3 sets of window dressings, natural light was seriously impeded. However as the weather was brilliant sunshine every day which meant we were out all day we were not too bothered. The room was well appointed with everything as it should be. The suite consisted of a bedroom, lounge, large bathroom with separate shower room and a luggage storage space. The decent sized bedroom had built in wardrobes, a wall-mounted flat screen TV and bedside tables. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a daily linen change. Lighting was excellent with a nightlight for in-bed reading in addition to lamps. The lounge contained a desk & chair, a sofa, armchairs and a 2nd wall-mounted TV. A mini-bar with limited stock is provided but no courtesy tray for hot drinks but this arrangement is fairly standard in Europe. I cannot function without tea as soon as my eyes are open so took my own travel kettle etc and this did not attract any comment (this has been known in other places but I like tea hot not tepid after a 10 minute journey from a kitchen!).Housekeeping and replenishment services were excellent given it was a holiday period for the local people as well. The bathroom offered a double wash basin unit with plenty of space for two sets of toiletries etc, a jacuzzi which worked and was spotless, a large walk-in shower with the option of overhead or hand held waterflow. Only slight issue was the decor was very dark in the shower area but lighting and mirrors in the grooming area were excellent. We took breakfast in a large room with central buffet tables. This area is either a conservatory or is actually outside but cleverly disguised as an indoor room for winter months. It is heated by two types of heating -high wall-mounted electric bar heaters and moveable outdoor patio heaters. Despite their best efforts, these heaters are not adequate. As our visit progressed I was wearing more layers each morning and I observed other guests resorting to outdoor clothing at breakfast. The food was fine but my other half felt that there should have been a cook to order menu for a hotel of this calibre. There was certainly no evidence of this being available. We had dinner in the AE restaurant on Christmas night which was absolutely fine but not exceptional. We also dined at their Michelin star restaurant Caelis and that's another story! Please see separate review. Suffice to say it was a week ago and we are still awestruck!!! The location of El Palace is very central with excellent access to good shopping streets, a short distance to the Barrio Gotic, a healthy walk to beach and nearby the Gaudi hotspots. This was our 2nd visit to Barca and we still have not used a bus or underground train. Lots of people comment about noise from the underground. I noticed it but it was not obstrusive. This is a city centre after all. We tend to use 5 star hotels in cities and although El Palace does not equate to other places we have stayed in recent times it was very good value. We would probably give it another chance.
UR122515189	I'm going to go against the grain here and say that I don't think El Palace compares with some of the more famous five star hotels that I've stayed in (George V, The Hassler). We were picked up by the hotel car and taken swiftly to the hotel, lead into reception and checked in(our room wasn't ready but it was 11.30 am) so we went to the restaurant to have lunch, it is decorated beautifully in keeping with the history of the building,they have done a great job sourcing beautiful reproduction furniture. We had lunch and it was fantastic but there was just no atmosphere, the place felt dead and we were the only people in it making it hard to sit back and relax. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was nice but just nice nothing amazing, the colours of the room were muted and the room felt dark and gloomy, the seating area only had one small sofa and two upright chairs so it wasn't a great place to lounge in. As it was our wedding anniversary my husband had (as a surprise) requested flowers, bubbly & cake in the room on arrival(he booked this two months in advance). They weren't there and when he tried to speak to reception got nowhere so he had to go downstairs and after a long conversation with them they explained they hadn't known if he wanted them on arrival or later in the day, its areas like this that they fall down in, a top 5 star hotel would do their utmost to make find out as it kind of ruined the surprise! Other things such as a leaking radiator which had obviously been like it for some time as the carpet was discloured, not being able to get through to room service, a breakfast delivered without butter, salt, jam and milk and you can understand why I wasn't blown away. The staff are friendly but they don't go out of their way to help, we had drink each night when we returned from dinner and bang on 12 the bar was shut, we weren't asked if we would like another drink..... We were on the 6th floor and you can here the metro, not enough to stop me sleeping but it's there. We had dinner in their michelin star restaurant and I wasn't impressed with it (please see my seperate review), the breakfast was good, it's in a good spot, walking distance to the shops etc. It was a nice stay but nothing special and for the money I don't think we would return.
UR122194358	Look at the pics - what a gorgeous place and the bathroom was as big as many of the hotel rooms I've stayed in! Rooms were large by European standards, and the walk-in closet was fantastic. Beautiful lobby, and the breakfast buffet was very satisfying. Can't say how good the beds were because we were so jet-lagged we could have slept in the hallway. Most European beds I found hard as a rock and I remember these as being close to that. Very nice location -- close to lots of restaurants, bars, and shopping. Only 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas. The area felt very safe, even at night. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Obviously one of the best hotels in Barcelona. Price was included in my travel package but I'm betting it was astronomical. Stay here if you can afford to pay for first class accommodations -- you won't be disappointed.
UR122029854	We were blown away with HOTEL EL PALACE BARCELONA (OLD RITZ) - never in all our travels have we had such service from any hotel. 5 Star service in every way. The hotel it self, is so beautiful that we were both blown away. We received exactly what we have asked for, a quiet room, away from the elevators, top floor and received a free upgrade on top of it. Free wi fi is available in the reception and lounge areas. The restaurant;s breakfast is out of this world, the selection so fantastic and well presented. The room it self, comes with everything you need. Do not expect a view if you want quietness, but this did not matter. This hotel is close to everything you want to experience in Barcelona, on the Las Rambles, close to wonderful restaurantants, all the shops, pharmacies, hop on hop off bus routes, the squares, etc. We are still blown away with this hotel and it staff - a must for every person who wants to stay in a beautiful 5 star hotel with good rates. Thank you El Palace for making our stay in Barcelona unforgettable.
UR121999455	it's a grand hotel. straight away feel homey when entering the property. very clean and the room is very spacious. the breakfast variety is not as many compared to some big hotel but very good quality food. lots of variety of spanish ham, iberico. very tasty, it melts in your mouth. the apple turnover is the best yet tasted. we also dine in the cafetaria. the chef is michelin rated so the food is quite good with a reasonable price.
UR121881908	First the good, and it really is good: The hotel is elegant and comfortable; the staff are courteous and helpful; and everything is clean and works. The location, close to, but away from, the madding crowd, was perfect for us. The L'Occitane cosmetics are a nice touch. Style and pampering are words that come to mind. Of course, you get what you pay for, and it ain't cheap. We followed advice of previous reviewers and asked for the top floor and an internal room. The less than perfect are that their king-sized bed is really two twins (cleverly connected, but even so...), you can still hear and feel the metro even on the top floor (though it's not nearly as noticeable as in the lobby), we had no traffic noise - but plenty of noise from the airconditioning units on the roof (white noise, but still noise), and they charge for wi-fi in the room (though it's free in the lobby), which I find outrageous.
UR121725757	We stayed here for two nights on a recent pre-Christmas break and really enjoyed the glamour and old fashioned style. Previously The Ritz (not sure if they still own it) it was refurbished four years ago. We stayed on the sixth floor in a room with a roman bath which was perfectly addictive. Breakfast was not to be missed in the covered courtyard. Staff and concierge were as to be expected, divine. It is well placed for shopping being just a stone's throw from Chanel, Louis Vuitton etc, but it's taxi ride for heel wearing ladies (or indeed men for that matter?!) if you want to have dinner in the Gothic Quarter.
UR121562587	For our first visit to Barcelona, having consulted all the usual sources, we chose the El Palace Hotel. We knew from the moment we arrived at the entrance, we couldn't have made a better choice. Well-located on a lovely boulevard and close to the Ramblas, this long-time Barcelona Ritz hotel has been beautifully up-dated on at least two occasions since it dropped the Ritz label in 1988. While the up-dating has incorporated all the modern conveniences, the decor is classic in style. The lobby, which incorporates a bar and a dining area at its far end, is huge and very elegant, with lovely sofas and magnificent chandeliers. The dining room for breakfast is reminiscent of a English garden room. There is a Michelin-starred dining room which unfortunately we felt obliged to avoid, still suffering the effects of excessive eating during a just-completed Mediterranean cruise. We did, however, sample (and were happy with) the food and drink in both the less-formal dining area and the breakfast room. In summary, the public areas of the hotel are as good as they come. Our room, on the top floor of the hotel, was of a good size and equally attractive and functional, with quality furnishings and a great bathroom including both a bath and separate shower. It's obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the planning as all one's needs seemed to be taken into account. The flat-screen television, for example, was incorporated into a mirror, so that one was unaware of a television in the room until it was activated with the remote control. A very comfortable bed and quiet heating and airconditioning systems made sleeping very easy. Of course, it is important also to have good staff. From the doorman to the front desk to the chambermaid, every one we encountered was very professional, congenial and proficient in English. We used to great advantage the very strong concierge desk in making arrangements for evening musical events and shopping recommendations. Yes, there were some minor concerns - if you didn't have (but require) an adapter for North American plugs, you have to ask for one; the standard bar of soap is hand-sized and not bath-sized, but the latter is available on request. In short, this is a great hotel if elegance and style and location are what you seek at a reasonable cost. We recommend it without reservation.
UR121558189	Highly recommend this beautiful hotel. Can walk everywhere from this location. The staff and service is amazing. The rooms are so luxurious that it's hard to leave. Can't wait to go back!
UR121187083	This hotel is aptly named. It is a palace in all senses. The restoration is a triumph. We treated ourselves to a Privilege Junior Suite (separate living and bedroom) and just loved the space. The separate shower stall in the ultra-luxurious bathroom was out of this world! Everything was super-luxurious in this hotel. The magnificent downstairs rooms are perfect for a drink, and the informative, friendly and professional barmen are first-class. Breakfast in a magnificent glass-covered area produced the best buffet I have ever seen anywhere. A special word for the wonderful and friendly housekeepers: they kept our room spotless, and never intruded. The location is perfect to see central Barcelona. We also took the hop-on hop-off buses and saw all the sights. We particularly appreciated the good tips of the concierge - they recommended excellent restaurants - as well as simple pizzerias when all we needed was a light meal. The people at Reception were efficient but disinterested. A superb experience. Only draw-back: we did not meet one manager during our 4 night stay; even the most perfectly oiled machine needs a human face to represent it. So Hotel Palace - put a duty manager on show and get him/her to say hello to the guests and show some warmth.
UR120946030	PERFECT LOCATION - 10-15 minutes by feet from every touristic point in Barcelona (passeig de gracia, barrio ghotico, ramblas, marina) 20min by feet from Sagrada familia, subway close to the hotel 5 STARS HOTEL - no doubt. It is actually the former Ritz hotel totally restored in 2008. The prices remain however (surprisingly) very reasonable. Very good surprise. Restaurant / Breakfast : very good and reasonable prices given the quality All the staff is very gentle and dedicated to the clients Luxury Rooms
UR120895677	From personal experience, this hotel should be ranked as one the top three hotels in Barcelona. Once u put a foot there, u can see, sense and smell the touches of luxury and dedication. If u like classic design, then this is definitely the place to go, u can see it from the reception through the lobby, bar, terrace all the way to their incredible rooms. the service is outstanding, we arrive a few hours before our check-in time, and since the room was ready, we went to bar for a couple of drinks, then we were surprised by the hotels manager greeting us and apologizing for nothing they've done wrong, and putting our drinks on the house for three two days "Unbelievable". The room service is very fast and the food is extraordinary. and they have L'occitane products in the bathrooms. Highly recommended!!! cant wait to go back..
UR120838521	Hotel El Palace is in a perfect location - two blocks from the Passeig de Gracia, and within walking distance of the Barri Gotic and the center of historic Barcelona. The public rooms are in a grand style from the turn of the 20th century, but the rooms are very comfortable and modern, with beautiful bath/dressing rooms - double sinks, separate rain shower stall and separate bathtub, and a private toilet. Service was excellent and very friendly.
UR120819379	The first mention should go to the excellent staff, very attentive, knowledgeable, kind and truely interested in making your stay perfect. Had a great room on the second floor with a balcony over looking the side street, Large room, fun TV in the 'mirror', no noise slept soundly. Breakfast is good although the over head heaters very hot and asked to be seated away from them. The toaster provided was inadequate and took an age to toast the bread!
UR120801890	This is a beautiful hotel with old world style and new world service. The breakfast area was in a beautiful atrium with outdoor seating available. The staff was very helpful. We also stayed there because we were told they had a remodeled gym in the hotel. It is a small, workout room and it may have been remodeled, but it only consists of two treadmills, two bikes and a small bright green bench. We affectionately called it a "Barbie workout room." We would definitely stay here again. It is so convenient to everything you would want to do in Barcelona.
UR120533895	Conveniently located to the Born, Gothic and La Ramblas, gorgeous interior and exterior (the old Ritz) , rooms were heavenly, loved the flat screen TV. This is the only place to stay in Barcelona. Fabulous daily breakfast buffet, best we've ever had!
UR120531028	We went to El Palace as part of our Honeymoon. The hotel is located in a great area close to but not really in any specific area (about a 10 minute walk from the bus you can take from the airport and about 5 minutes from the closest Metro). This was our first '5-star' hotel and it did not disappoint. The rooms were large for European standards complete with a foyer, bathroom with separate tub and shower (with the rain-shower head), a large bedroom area and a walk-in closet bigger than the bathroom (you could easily sleep 2 kids or small adults in the closet). The entire place just smelled nice -- if you ever wondered what angel's tears smelled like it would probably be the scent in the halls (but less in the bedrooms) of the El Palace. We had accidentally left our guidebook on the plane and so went directly to the concierge and asked what there was to do around town. Every person we spoke to at the concierge desk (there were a few that rotated depending on time of day) spoke perfect English and were extremely helpful and patient with us. We had the buffet breakfast every day in the hotel which was situated in an outdoorish (part was actually open air and part had a semi-permanent canopy over top. The brunch was great and had alot of diversity with Spanish staples like sausages as well as an interesting Asian dim sum area. There was a club downstairs that we unfortunately never made it to as well as a spa in the hotel that we also never made it to. The Michelin Starred restaurant in the building looked great but had a lot of fois gras dishes which due to a strange twist in fate is the only food I'm actually allergic to so we did not try that either. Most people there were older than us (we're late 20s) and there were some kids ranging from around 5 up to teenage years. I got the impression we were there outside of tourist season (early October) and so the hotel wasn't packed. The entire time we wore Tshirts and jeans and not once did we get a disapproving look from the staff -- everyone was super friendly and most spoke at least English and Catalan if not Spanish and other languages as well (we heard German, French, and Mandarin from the guests in addition to English and Spanish). If you're looking for a beautiful hotel that clearly says 'old world charm' with a fantastic staff and a laid back but clearly 'expensive' vibe this is a great place. If you're looking for a trendy hotel right in the middle of the 'beautiful people' this is probably not the place for you. Equally good for couples and for families.
UR120442188	We stayed at this wonderful hotel to celebrating our 50th Anniversary. What a wonderful choice. It is in the perfect location. We were walking distance to all the sources of Barcelona. I can't wait to to back again.. It is truly a BEAUTIFUL PLACE. The Hotel itself was just like being in a castle. I felt like a Queen!
UR120420035	Excellent service and friendly staffs. Convenient located. A lot of tourist spots are within walking distance. We'll definitely go back to this hotel.
UR120289451	....there is no better place to stay than at the El Palace. The location is perfect. The staff could not have been more helpful. Restaurant recommendations were right on, requests were handled with professionalism and speed. The lobby is spectacular and the rooms were beautifully appointed and spotless. We will definitely be back!
UR120257055	this hotel is really close to perfect: Wonderful rooms, good view across Barcelona (at least from the top floor, where we stayed), very friendly and attentive staff, great architecture, perfectly situated and yet silent. Magnificent!
UR120222975	The Palace is the best hotel in Barcelona. Not only is the facility a top notch world class hotel, the location is great (within walking distance to everything). Add to that the staff, which consistently goes above and beyond, is the very best of any hotel I've stayed at in the world. I sharedwithnthem this was our 25th anniversary and they upgraded us at no extra charged to a Junior Suite and sent a bottle of great Cava to our room. What a great way to start our vacation and celebration. Thanks to everyone at the Palace and we'll see you again soon!
UR120107614	What an wonderful hotel, it is old style glitz and glamour but the staff are so friendly and helpful that there is no snooty-ness, they bent over backwards to answer questions, make reservations and order taxis! The rooms are gorgeous and luxurios with huge bathroom and double sink. The hotel is tucked away off of the shopping strip but was within easy walking distance of all the sites including La ramblas & Sagrada Família, seeing lots of others on the way. Loved this hotel and not only would recommend but can not wait to return! Beautiful city, people, food and hotel.
UR119863472	My husband and I recently returned from a 7 night stay at the Palace. The hotel, formerly known as the Ritz, was closed for two years to undergo a renovation that is now completed. This is indeed a 5 star hotel--excellent location! We had a great time and would recommend this hotel to anyone. The Trip Advisor advice to request a high floor away from the lift resulted in us having a room on the top floor with a small balcony---perfect! The rooms have sound proof windows and room darkening shades but we never found the street noise to be a bother. The bathrooms are lovely with separate shower/tub and a separate room for the toliet. Bathrobes and slippers are provided. Beds are very comfortable.We had a classic deluxe double with an additional twin bed for our 20 year old son. Housekeeping services were excellent. The public rooms are old world European, very elegant. The staff was gracious ,friendly and very competent. The concierge was able to arrange futbol tickets to see Team Barcelona while we were there. They also helped with tickets to a flamenco performance and train tickets to Figures--home of the Salvador Dali museum. We had breakfast in the Garden Room twice---pricey but lovely. We also had cocktails in the bar area and also dinner at the hotel one evening--just wonderful. There is a late night lounge with live music in the basement that had fabulous drinks, great bartenders and was a fun way to end a long day of touring. I would recommend the hotel and the city of Barcelona to anyone! We had a great time!
UR119766557	2 nights at El Palace, the former Ritz hotel, wonderful lobby in Louis XVI style, great breakfast in the covered interior courtyard, very efficient concierge, comfortable rooms, TV with many international channels, Manager Cristina does a great job
UR119703814	El Palace made our stay in Barcelona very special. The service, rooms, location were all excellent. The concierge desk were tremendously helpful. The complimentary breakfast was the best we have had in Europe, served in a magnificent outdoor/indoor space with warm heaters for a chilly morning. This hotel was once a Ritz Hotel and it has all the amenities of a Ritz. We would definitely stay there again on our next trip back to Barcelona.
UR119643357	My husband & I stayed at this amazing hotel after disembarking from a Mediterranean Cruise and we were more than impressed with El Palace! The hotel is very elegant and the decor is sumptuous and lavish. The service is exceptional - from the door man to the Reception Desk to all the staff, the service is faultless. The room was very beautiful, the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom was splendid! We were also very happy with our breakfasts and dinner - impeccably prepared and very tasty! The location is very good - central to all the amazing sites of Barcelona. Really, there nothing negative we could say about El Palace - we will have no hesitation in recommending this opulent and refined establishment and look forward to returning to El Palace in the future!
UR119595532	Found the hotel very good. Rooms are very spacious. Location is great as it's away from the hustle bustle but still within walking distance from all heart of the city. A bit expensive. The only criticism I have is that there was no water kettle or coffee in the room. I would expect such a hotel to have this in the room.
UR119359734	My husband and I stayed at El Palace for three nights in early October. We chose this hotel for its proximity to our daughter's apartment (she is studying in Barca for the semester). We went into it having read all the reviews on TripAdvisor so we were prepared for the train vibration. The hotel is very formal and grand. The bar/salon area is beautiful and we enjoyed a nice afternoon snack and drinks there one afternoon. Our room was on the 4th floor and spacious, with a separate sitting area with a desk, couch and TV. The bathroom was quite large with a shower, double sink and tub. The tub was very modern with many settings for a wonderful spa experience. The gym was too small for my husband and not much choice of equipment. The service at every point was great, from the bellman, Norman, who showed us to our room to the maids who came in twice daily and did a great job. The front desk staff was pleasant and helpful, except I always seem to have trouble with restaurant recommendations from the staff at high-end hotels. I can never get a good, local, inexpensive name from them. They always want to send us to expensive touristy spots no matter how much I ask them not to. They sent us to La Gavina on the waterfront. The food was not good and the prices were high. Don't go there! Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at El Palace. As long as you can get over feeling the floor vibrate every once in a while, you will enjoy this hotel.
UR119302758	excellent standard of hotel. Spacious rooms. Breakfast and service amazing.
UR119076291	We stayed at El Palace for a couple of nights before our cruise this year. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We loved the location as we were able to walk to most places. The service was excellent and the room very comfortable and clean. While they did charge for Wireless access, they do have computers in the business area off the lobby that one can use for free. We are planning to return next year. While we did hear the noise from the subway, it didn't disturb our sleep.
UR119069413	The El Palace in Barcelona is a beautiful hotel recently renovated. It is right in the heart of the Catolonia area. Although located on a major high street, once inside its very quite. I did not experience any of the noise some recent reviewers complained about rather my sleep was blissfull. While the service was excellent and the hotel luxurious, you sort of get a sense that this place is more suited for the retired, elderly crowd. However, if i ever return to barcelona i will certainly stay at the El Palace!
UR118901006	The noise began at 4 or 5 in the morning, we believe it was either the subway or the elevators... Although I sleep well like a rock, this intermitent noise disturbed mine and my husband´s sleep. This noise ocurred in intervals of 10-15 minutes. We stayed on the 5th floor and had a hard time sleeping. Unfortunately this noise obscured our stay.
UR118583159	Elegant, luxurious hotel with beautiful, spacious rooms. Friendly, helpful staff. Very expensive drinks in the bar downstairs but the live music was good. I ordered the club sandwich at the bar and it was good, so were the fries that came with it. The temperature in the shower alternated between scalding hot and cold. I spilled water on the bathroom floor. After I wiped it up, the towel was covered with dirt and long hairs from the previous guest. The noise and vibration from the train were unbearable. I didn't get any sleep my first night as a result of it. I was on the 2nd floor initially but requested to be moved to the 6th floor. The noise and vibration weren't as bad there but my sleep was still disrupted. El Palace is nice, elegant, and in a great location, but the noise and vibration made it impossible for me to sleep peacefully, and I'm not a light sleeper. I wouldn't stay here again even if it was free.
UR118487558	The Doorman was appalled that I opened the front door myself and slipped inside unassisted. Another guest was standing in the opulent foyer, looking very much a "Camilla look-alike" I was looking around for "Charles". This hotel is everything you would expect of a Palace. Grand in style, abundant in offerings. Clean and well appointed, the room was large, lavish and very comfortable. I did hear the trains, but a mere distant rumbling and not at all annoying, the main train station is just two blocks away. I had lashed out on something special for my last night in Barcelona, and was not disappointed. I had breakfast at the city markets so can't comment on their dining services, I can only imagine they are in keeping with the rest of this hotel and are of an acceptable standard. It was fun to stay in this rather "royal" style of hotel.
UR118364017	Me and my husband stayed at the El Palace hotel in Barcelona this summer for 2 nights. We had received a very nice upgrade and the room was beautiful. The service was good, the hotel renovated, old luxury, and impressive. I found the breakfast to be good, but not the best I have had in 5 star hotels. There is a great bar in the hotel, where they serve cocktails and where time has stood still, very nice! They had a good housekeeping service, we always found our room clean and good turn down service. It's well positioned, in the city centre.
UR118295653	After an 11 day holiday covering Florence and Venice my Wife and I stayed here for two nights en route to our home in Spain. This is an exceptionally good hotel, well situated and with excellent service. The noise from the trains was minimal but we were on the top floor. The only problem was with housekeeping but this was soon resolved. Staff very helpful and accommodating. Would recommend and certain to stay again.
UR118189000	El Palace is in a good location, roughly between La Rambla and Gaudi's Sacrada Familia. Breakfasts are better value than you may think. A basket of croissants, bread rolls, danish pastries and pain au chocolat is 14 euros and perfect for 2 people (one each of all above) Beer in the hotel is the cheapest drink at 7 euros and is served with complimentary cheese straws, crisps and nuts. The house keeping is adequate but they should clean all blankets and bed spreads after each guest if possible to avoid what happened to me, a stained blanket. Mini-Bar prices are as you would expect but 5 euros for 0.5 litre bottles of water is more expensive than it should be for such a basic necessity. The concierge was average, nowhere near as useful as the tourist information office situated near Gaudi's La Pedrera. Overall, I found Barcelona worth seeing. It has good transport and walking around is pretty easy but I got irritated at the lack of information in Castellano and of how all plays etc are in Catalan. If you want to be in the best areas, check out the Starbucks, they are well located.
UR118014234	This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The rooms and large, clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are very large and modern. Service was excellent. I highly recommend this hotel.
UR117960221	My 24 year old daughter and I just did a mother daughter trip and stayed at El Palace Hotel. The Staff was very helpful(Concierge were great) and the service was top notch, Our room which was a junior suite was exquisite, everything down to the nightly turn down service to the quality of the linens. Everyone spoke English and being from the States I felt at home there. The one major issue I had was the constant subway noise that seemed to run under the hotel. It disturbed our sleep and I found it very unpleasant.We had room 126, so I would not suggest that particular room. we also heard the room service bell constantly as we were next to the butler's pantry.
UR117950671	I was shifted from Rey Juan Carlos I Hotel to El Palace due to electrical difficulties as the receptionist told me! Regardless the train little sounds ,and the internet way of serving, El Palace experience was totally great experience
UR117872211	I loved this hotel. It has such an old-world feel and the service is impeccable. Here, the doorman smiles, and the beds are always turned down for the evening. The room is gorgeous and the bathrooms are very nice. It's just like the photos. As a lovely surprise, we received a complementary bottle of cava for our anniversary. This hotel was near enough to the sights, so we always walked to the Gothic quarter, the Borne neighborhood, and Passig de Gracia. I am a spa-junkie and I had the most FABULOUS deep-tissue massage and facial at the Mayan Luxury Spa. It's not large by any means. You won't find pools and jaccuzies and their locker room is tiny. But what you will find is a very professional service and what they do is fantastic. I started off in their sauna, and the day just melted away. I was so tired from running from one Barcelona attraction to the other, that I needed this time for myself. It was so nice.. and quiet. Candles and lavendar smells. After my services, I was offered tea and fruit on their daybed. This experience definately exceeded my expectations. Husbands and boyfriends.. if you are reading.. surprise your ladies. Some negatives- Honestly, yes, you hear the rumble. We stayed on the 6th floor and we heard it. I don't think it was that bad, but I feel like it's a shame that this hotel has that problem. It's worse on the first floor. At the spa, during the service, I didn't hear it.. but I think I was really enjoying myself. I don't really know what the timings are for it.. but it seems very random to me. Another negative.. sometimes.. the water switches temperatures.. hot to cold.. but it corrects itself soon enough. Third negative.. though maybe not entirely their fault.. It's a European hotel, so it has European beds.. which means they have double hard/firm beds. However, they do not have European rooms.. because we thought our standard room was huge! Overall, fantastic stay.. some misses.. but I would stay here again.
UR117577601	We stayed here for just four nights and loved it. The hotel is well situated within walking distance of shopping and the Old Town. There are some small restaurants/bars nearby too. The room we had has beautiful and the bathroom had a massive shower and a sunken Roman bath. Breakfast was to die for ! I don't think I've ever seen such a selection before, and if you want something different, just ask. The Hotel caters for all nationalities. The staff very helpful and friendly. I would definitely go back.
UR117534977	We had the delight of staying in this hotel just as they were completing the renovations. We were not able enjoy the Bar downstairs that had a grand piano and beautiful antique brass coffee machine as the paint was still drying! However I did get to see where the athletic room with pool will be located in the future. The staff was attentive and able to answer questions and give suggestions. the location was righ in the center of everything, We walked a couple short blocks to eat Tapas and take tour buses. The concierge gave wonderful recommendations and when we decided to rent a car they had one available right at the hotel all taken care of...it was a brand new Mini
UR117475894	My wife and I spent 3 nights here in July while celebrating our anniversary - decided to splurge a bit on a nice hotel. This hotel is absolutely beautiful, with a turn-back-the-clock plush feel. From the moment walked in the door we were treated like royalty. We made a passing reference to the recent Wimbledon final and the front desk clerk - unsure of the outcome - called a concierge who ran over to fill us in on the details. This set the tone for the rest of our stay...the staff was always willing to go the extra mile. The room was very nice with a spacious sitting area and massive bathroom - which was actually split into two separate rooms - one for the shower and one for the toilet. Bed was comfortable. Nice bathrobes. High end toiletrees. Just an all around luxury experience. The location is also quite good. The Ramblas is a short walk away and the tony Eixample neighborhood - home to many Gaudi houses - is also very close. If this hotel is within your budget, you will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here.
UR117268578	My husband and I stayed here before and after our Mediterranean cruise and loved this hotel. Everyone, from the doorman to the concierge to the housekeeping staff, was amazing. A wonderful smell permeated the common areas and the facility was very clean. The bathroom was beautiful and modern and the television was IN the mirror over the fireplace. The hotel offers turndown service and free wi-fi, but there's a catch. You must request a login from the front desk and it's good for only 1 hour per day. I've read that the hotel offers shuttle service to the airport and cruise terminal, but neither of these proved true. Still, the hotel was great and in a great location. We were two blocks from Las Ramblas and did lots of walking! There are also two metro stops within walking distance of the hotel, making it easy to navigate the city. An added bonus is that we arrived in Barcelona at 8:30am and were relieved to find that our room was ready and available for a nap after a long international flight. However this spoiled us because after our cruise returned to Barcelona we were expecting the same grace but found that the hotel was completely booked (9 cruises were coming and going that day) and had to wait from 8am until 2pm to get our room).
UR117145856	I stayed at this hotel at the beggining of the year and it was very good. It is all renovated and so comfortable - and I was in the smallest room! Also very classy, old style class Room: clean, spacious, beautiful decoration Bathroom: stylish, clean Breaskfast was fantastic (great variaty) ! - and in a really nice place Staff was kind and always there when you needed. Location: good but not great - near to a lot of touristic sites, but not so close either (walk to Las Ramblas takes around 15 mins). My only issues: 1) shower - it really changed temperature - boiling water to cold in seconds- and vice-versa in the middle of your shower! I hope they fixed it 2) train (?) noise : I think it was the train, or subway, and it went on day and night. Nothing too bad (but I was in 5th floor)
UR116922860	After staying at two other supposedly 5 Star hotels on my trip one being a new hotel and one modern I decided to go with something traditional and it worked. I was doing this part of my trip alone so I wanted to feel safe and I did. From entering the hotel to the day I left I was treated like a queen (albeit was August and not very busy, Barcelona residents leave town in August). The concierge team were my saving grace can't thank them enough. The maids were like little fairies, so quiet and discreet. The rooms were lovely although one complaint I had was the location of the TV it was on the side not in front of the bed but this is minor and only my personal preference. I was on the top floor and did hear the train but it was pretty distant and I got used to it after one night. Not sure how noisy it would be on the first floor? I did like the Gothic, Born area of the cIty for its bars and narrow streets but I heard that this was sometimes a little unsafe. I must also commend the beautiful lady who greeted me as I arrived and was constantly 'there'. She was so gracious and professional I think her name was Christine but I may be wrong anyway she was the best. All in all a truly 5 or 6 star experience, very rare in this day and age even at the most expensive hotels. Well worth it!!!
UR116885410	I had the chance to stay at El Palace last July. it has been from the beginning to the end a real luxury and personalized experience that few hotel in the world can offer to the guest. The welcoming smile and the generosity, humility and kindness of the staff warm my heart. The attention paid to details of the entire hotel, the rooms are absolutely top notch and immaculate. The restaurant, DO NOT MISS the gastronomic restaurant Caelis which has been a truly moment of pure sensation with the product and the style of the cuisine. Everything has been so well organized for me and my guest, thanks to two person who are a real plus in the staff and know what is the meaning of luxury service. POR FAVOR, ask for Katharina and Celine to have a memorable stay at the Palace and to feel the proper way of Barcelona. One point missing at the hotel, a swimming pool, but the hotel is not so far from the see.
UR116817133	What you see on their website is what you get. Great location, great restaurant and bar, and very helpful and friendly service. The bed was a little too firm for my liking, but I would recommend to friends and family.
UR116612492	We stayed at the Palace for 5 nights in July and had a wondersful time. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff exceptional, and the room lovely. There are two very good restaurants in the hotel and many more within walking distance. A short walk to Las Ramblas for great people watching, eating, and starting hop on, hop off bus tours.
UR116582336	After returning from our cruise we had one more night in Barcelona before flying back to the states. We arrived at the hotel around 9am and they gave us a room immediately. It was clear they went out of their way to find us an available room. The rooms was awesome, and the service Ritz Carlton quality. Beautiful living room with quaint bar. First class breakfast buffet next morning included in the room price was served in their atrium. Really beautiful, great service, delicious. There are many less expensive hotels, but if you are looking for high end or want to splurge you will not be disappointed.
UR116503832	We were at your palace for one night prior to a cruise. It was gorgeous and the staff was beautiul. We will be back!
UR116434025	Very nice hotel. Great staff, even though the front desk was a little indifferent at times. The rooms were wonderful. Nice, clean, big, modern...really as nice as it can get in a big city European Hotel. The bathrooms were awesome. The locations is really ideal. Close to everything. easy walk, or easy cab ride to every where you want to go. The bar upstairs was good. The bar downstairs was amazing. live music, great bar tender. We went downstairs every night we were there. Hard to find much to complain about.
UR116305466	I have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world. All modern and fancy and great service. This hotel is the old Ritz! Renovated. But still in keeping with the period furniture and brass railing on the stairs. The large swag drapes. Opulence from the 15-15th century with guilded furniture. If you like that, then this is the place for you. The staff was fabulous. And let me tell you I am fussy. We were served comp. champagne when we arrinved. Exactly what I needed! We I can keep going but no need. You get the idea. Oh its close to everything. High end shopping and the Ramblas, which is a fantastic shopping, eating, enterntainment marquise of Barcelona. A must see.
UR116107783	We enjoyed our stay in El Palace a lot. Room was neat and quite spacious. The location superb. Just couple of blocks from Catalunia square, Rambla and Pacei dei Gracia. The service was very good. Michelin star restaurant - outstanding food and good vine selection. The only thing which we didin't like - the metro beneath. You could feel the trains passing by, despite the fact that we were on the 4th floor. It was not bad, but for such a hotel it was a minus. Part from that - everything was perfect and we will gladly stay there once again.
UR115861079	My wife, son, and I stayed here after our cruise for a few days. It is a beautiful hotel with a very nice staff. I liked that there were good restaurants nearby. We had a junior suite and it was very nice. Be sure to check the bar out downstairs, it is very cool with all the woodwork and just a neat setting. We were here on a Sunday and had the brunch at the hotel restaurant which is in an outdoor courtyard. It is beautiful the way they have it set up. Before our cruise, we stayed at Le Meridien near La Ramblas, and it was nice but much more expensive and I thought El Palace had more class.
UR115849690	I chose this hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor - I was not disappointed and most of the reviews were accurate. I did not give the hotel 5 stars because of 2 things - the constant (but not too loud) noise from the underground Metro line, and the way that wireless internet is handled. If you want "free WiFi" - you have to go down to the hall or business center (which are very beautiful and comfortable), then ask the front desk for a "code" which allows you to use the WiFi for 1 hr - then if you need more time, you must go back to the counter and ask for another one. For a hotel of this caliber, they should understand that their guests want absolute comfort, privacy and convenience without being "nickled and dimed". If you want to stay in your room - no problem, it's just an extra 15 Euro/day for WiFi. Those are my only (small) complaints. The hotel is beautiful, the location is great - most of the sightseeing is easily within walking distance. The staff was outstanding and very pleasant. I would recommend this hotel to couples, families and singles for short stays in Barcelona.
UR115575673	Large rooms and bathrooms. Very clean. Great service. Turn down service with dark chocolates every night was a plus for me!
UR115368972	From the minute we stepped into the hotel, which was very early on a holiday morning, we were treated famously. Despite the early hour (9 AM) the staff was able to get a room ready for us and from there we were able to start our day touring in Barcelona. The breakfast room was magnificent with great choices and excellent service. The hotel itself is old world beautiful, the rooms are spacious and quiet (the subway underneath is really not an issue, don't let that bother you). The bathrooms are magnificent with rain drop showers and whirlpool baths. Service- outstanding, whatever you wanted was there in minutes. The concierges were very courteous and helpful. One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Centrally located, can walk to many attractions and the harbor. Expensive but worth every penny!!
UR115358679	Stayed here in early July and would heartily recommend it to everyone. Pricey, but definitely worth it. The hotel is first class and the staff are so helpful and friendly. Ask for Alexis in customer service....he is a great resource in helping with tours, sight seeing and restaurants. Loved every minute of our stay here! You do hear the vibrations from the nearby metro, but it is really no big deal. It would be nice if wifi was available in the rooms as well, but again, not a big deal, as internet is available in the business center.
UR115173645	Arrived exhausted after a night flight from NY. The initial reception was a bit cool, as there was discrepancy over the date we were to check out. Rather than accept that I had reserved for 3 nights rather than 4, the desk attendant proceded to pull out a book of all correspondence and communication we had exchanged, apparently in an attempt to prove me wrong. No big deal, but certainly not an embrace of "the customer is always right" philosophy. After that shaky start all was wonderful. Javier showed us to our lovely room on the fourth floor and explained the workings of the room and its features with wit and grace, and he had a cheery greeting whenever we saw him during our stay. Room furnishings and the bath were not "showy" but definitely of a 5 star calibre. Can't imagine that the minor rumbling of the metro beneath the hotel could annoy anyone but the most finicky traveller. For us it was a non-issue. Hallways are wide and bright. The lobby is magnificent as is the breakfast terrace (although breakfast prices seem unreasonably high.) There is a bar at the rear of the lobby, but it is very quiet, and there is actually only table seating.....no bar stools. The place to go for more action is the scotch bar, down a staircase from the lobby. This relatively small room features a proper bar, 2 attentive and amusing bartenders, and live entertainment in the evenings until 2 a.m. Even the size of the pours seems more generous than the usually stingy European style. HIghly recommend a visit or two downstairs. The hotel is in a lovely residential neighborhood that's an easy morning stroll to several breakfast options, as well as restaurants for lunch and dinner. The major sites and shopping are also walkable or an easy cab ride. (Concierge service is great. There seemed always to be at least 3 or 4 on duty, and they arranged for a perfect private walking tour our first day in town.) Were originally scheduled to stay at the Mandarin Oriental but decided on a more Old World experience. After checking out the MO on the busy Passeig de Gracia I'm convinced we made the absolute right decision.
UR114997194	My boyfriend and I spent 3-/12 days at the El Palace Hotel before departing on a cruise. This hotel did not disappoint!!! We had an early flight into Barcelona and as soon as we arrived at the hotel, the staff advised that they had held a room for us so we could get comfortable right away. Both of us I were blown away by the staff and attention to detail at this hotel. Nothing was overlooked. When I inquired at 10 p.m., before leaving for dinner, if we could possibly get additional pillows for our room the next day, the gentlemen immediately informed me that the pillows would be in our room upon our return that evening. His response was "we are a 24 hour hotel, just let us know what and when you need something and we'll take care of it". Impressive! The room was a very nice size, not huge but definitely big enough for two. The bed was super comfortable and the room was extremely clean. Our room was cleaned every day and turned down even if we left twice in one evening. They didn't miss a detail! Our room at the front of the hotel on the third floor overlooked the lovely boulevard and statue. The bath was beyond huge and was separated by a hallway with another door for extreme privacy. We could practically swim in the mosaic tub. We felt as if we had checked into a beautiful spa when going into the bath. The huge glassed in shower is separate from the tub and has a waterfall shower head directly from the ceiling. Felt so great, we never wanted to leave the bath!! From the third floor I have to admit you can hear and feel the rumble of the subway. It never bothered my boyfriend but it took me a day to get used to it. If you are bothered by noise and some light shaking, this aspect will annoy you. Also, the breakfast is very expensive. We had a continental breakfast included with our room. I ordered cereal and fresh fruit once and it was $22 Ouch! But there are option! One morning I walked across the street to the market picked up some fresh fruit and yogurt for about 3 Euro. There are many little restaurants close to the hotel so that is also a great option. I definitely would not let this aspect deter you as there are tons of options for breakfast and the hotel is just too fantastic to let those little issue scare you away. Also, buy bottles of water from the market across the street. To exchange money, there is also a bank directly across the street. Bring your passport! I did want to eat in their beautiful restaurant downstairs but couldn't justify the prices of an additional $20 per person or $40 per day. Perhaps if we stayed a week, we would have experienced it but there was just so much to do and see! Barcelona is a vibrant, exciting city with so much to do during the day and a place where the city really gets going around 9 or 10 p.m. for dinner. We loved this aspect of the city. You don't have to eat late but it is definitely part of the fun and part of the overall experience of Barcelona. We never had a bad experience. The architecture, art, food and people were everything that we had hoped for and more! We would leave for dinner at 10 p.m. and stroll through the streets. We would finish up around Midnight or 1 a.m. and would walk back to the El Palace. We never felt any fear. Of course, it is always good to be aware of your surroundings and not pull wads of cash out in public. Tthere are pickpockets, as everywhere, but if you exercise good judgement and keep your valuables in front pockets and purses in front of you and walk with confidence there won't be any problems. Also, ladies, don't hang your purse on the back of your chair especially in outdoor cafes. The hotel is in a fantastic location with easy walking access to everything. Places not to miss! Sagrada Família - Make sure you go inside ... Incredible!!! Casa Milà (don't miss the roof terrace). You might want to take the elevator as it is about 12 flights and pretty exhausting. Anything and everything Gaudi. Las Ramblas - Experience it both day and night - Completely difference experiences.. During the day a must see is Mercat de Boqueria, this is the most amazing marketplace ever! Sights, sounds, colors & smells - Beautiful!! Walk all the way to the end of Las Ramblas, you won't be disappointed. Eat tapas late at night, one recommendation is Divinus which is about 4 to 5 long blocks from the hotel. Yummy! We also ate at 4 Cats which we also loved. I believe it is located in the Gothic district another area of Barcelona which is terrific to explore! Narrow alleys filled with shops, tapa bars, cava bars and apartments. You'll have to ask the hotel for the location of 4 Cats, it is pretty tough to find located in a narrow little alleyway but well worth the experience to find it! Too much to see in just three and a half days! Day Three, we took a day trip to Montserrat for Cava tasting and a vist to the Basilica. It was above and beyond and worth the hour trip each way The Benedictine Monk retreat and Basilica is spectacular with amazing views of Catalunya. After visiting the Basilica take the cable car to the top of the mountain to experience magnificent views of the very unusual rock formations and breathtaking views from every direction. You will be blown away by the views. Wear good walking shoes and take time to explore!! We can't wait to return to Barcelona and we will definitely be back to El Palace Hotel where we received a warm, warm welcome every time we walked in the door! We belong to Leading Hotels of the World and received some very nice perks such as free Continental breakfast, early check-in and free in-room Internet. If you forget to pack something, there is every shop in the world in Barcelona. Save room in your luggage to bring home some treasures. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions - karsd@aol.com. Above all else, Enjoy Barcelona
UR114931484	Barcelona was our last destination on our two week visit to Spain and I thought I had saved the best hotel for last. Boy, were we disappointed. The check-in process was the poorest service we received after staying at several wonderful and welcoming hotels in Spain (including the Westin Palace in Madrid, the AlmaSevilla and the Hotel Alhambra Palace). The male receptionist was downright obnoxious and impolite. Also, when I asked for a room on a higher floor to avoid the rumble of the subway, he sneered at me and said that he was not aware of any noise or vibration and that the 2nd floor would be fine for our Junior Suite (this conversation took place while several trains shook the reception area). Well, he was of course very very wrong, the vibration at this hotel is quite intense throughout the property and we were moved to the 5th floor later that evening, but it was still about the same. We also had to wait over an hour for our bags to be brought up to our room after check-in. The bellhop seemed very out of sorts when he finally arrived and told us he was too busy. (understaffed property??) Also, none of the check-in staff told us about ANY of the amenities of the hotel. I had to make a point of stopping by the concierge desk and asked them directly, something all our other hotels always make a point of doing (isn't that part of good service??). In addition, when I called housekeeping and the front desk for service in our room, the phone just rang and rang. No one picked up at housekeeping and the front desk didn't answer until after about 15 rings. Deeply frustrated with paying more than $600 a night for terrible service, I went down to the front desk and complained. They listened while I spoke, but were still generally unhelpful and unwelcoming. While the room was clean, the size was no where near what we expect from a Junior Suite, just the size of a regular guest room. Also, the sheets were not of good quality and so filled with pilled areas that it rubbed against my legs and disturbed my sleep (that is when I finally did fall asleep from the metro noise and vibration). The best part of the room was the bathroom which was spacious. They have a "pillow menu" which is a joke since they don't really provide any special pillows at all. One other point worth mentioning, the key they provide is a regular key with very large key fob tassle which you much drop off everytime you leave the hotel. So, when you return, you have to stop by the concierge to pick it up. This presents two problems: 1) If they are helping someone, you will have to wait quite a long time while until they are finished, 2) they never ask for any identification which made me feel uneasy and questioned their security since at times it was a new concierge who had not seen us before. There were other issues with the restaurant and concierge service too (ex. no reservation as promised when we showed up at a restaurant) but I don't want to make this review any longer than it already is! We would never stay at the property again. It was a complete dissapointment and overpriced. Be forewarned if you choose it, you will not have a restful satisfying stay. This is definitely not a 5 or even 4 star property. BE FOREWARNED IF YOU CHOOSE TO STAY HERE!!!!
UR114804567	From the moment we walked in to the time we left we were treated like Kings. Wonderful staff and service, and an upgrade to a Junior suite! When we are next in Barcelona we know where we'll be staying :)
UR114783027	We were there for our honeymoon and the place was wonderful. Great location and excellent staff
UR114647278	This is the second time we stayed in the centrally located El Palace, and it was just as wonderful as last year. As a welcome present we had a box of chocolates in the room, and a free glass of champagne in the bar. We had a "classic de luxe" room, large and very comfortable (with two easy chairs, working area, etc.). The TV screen, when not in use, is a beautiful big mirror, and the minibar is hidden behind a trompe l'oeil wall panel. Beautiful bathroom, with separate shower. WC behind sliding door. A beautiful orchid in the bathroom, also lots of l'Occitane toiletries, and, needless to say, bathrobes and slippers. The turn down service each night was impeccable: of course the beds were made ready for the night, curtains were closed, bedlamps were put on – but also the bins were emptied, we got clean towels, clean "bed mats", chocolates and some reading matter. The beds were very comfortable, and the far-away rumbling of the metro, which is mentioned in one of the reviews, didn't bother us at all. In the morning we got the newspaper of our choice. Breakfast (a lavish buffet, with freshly pressed juice) is in the lovely Garden restaurant. The lobby is a sumptuous affair, all chandeliers and antiques, but somehow very welcoming. At the end of the lobby is the AE brasserie, which is open from 11.00 AM to 23.00 PM, and where we had a very good lunch. But don't forget to have dinner at the Michelin starred Caelis restaurant , which is just about perfect. There is also a downstairs bar (open from 18.00 PM), often with life music, but we did not go there. One word about the hotel staff: they really make you feel welcome, giving excellent service with a smile. (E.g.: the concierge looked up some trains for us, and even called the station to find out from which platform they would depart!)
UR114537177	We stayed for 2 nights in this delightful hotel in a classic deluxe and it was extremely comfortable. The staff are so welcoming and helpful and the bar service is really slick. We were on the third floor of the hotel overlooking a side street and only felt the occasional rumble from the metro but it certaintly didn't keep us awake and the soundproofing is so good there is no traffic noise either. Our room was spacious with a wonderful roomy bathroom that had 2 sinks, bath and great rain shower along with L'Occitane toiletries. The hotel drinks are very expensive but then it is 5 star but the bar is beautiful. (Euro 14 for a Bloody Mary and Euro 7 for a coke / coffee / tea). Perhaps if they lowered their bar prices slightly more people might stay to have a drink (bar was always very empty). There is also a lovely outside patio area where you can have drinks and breakfast and there is also a downstairs cocktail bar with live music from 10.30. We didn't eat in the hotel. We had breakfast each day at Farga a 5 minute walk along Grand Via just past Passeig Garcia. We would definitely return to this hotel and Barcelona has so much to offer the holidaymaker. The hotel does not offer free wi-fi but there are terminals you can use.
UR113620139	Spent two nights at this elegant old hotel. Impressive public rooms and good central location. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The hotel would appear to sit on top of the Metro and our bedroom shook each time a train passed. The room itself was of good size and quite comfortable - the bathroom was well equipped. Breakfast was adequate.
UR113094823	We stayed at El Palace for three nights. Since we had arranged to stay in a "hip" hotel in Madrid, we opted for a traditional, old-school hotel in Barcelona. There is something to be said for traditional and old-school service that you just do not get in any of these younger, hip hotels! The hotel was renovated about a year or two ago, and it is very elegant, opulent and beautiful. The service is, in one word: impeccable. The staff was definitely formal and ready to serve at a moment's notice, but there was always an underlying friendliness and warmth - in other words, I never felt them to be "snooty". We are part of the leaders club, so we were given an upgrade to a junior suite. We stayed in room 329. There was no view, but the room was located in a corner of the hotel (not sure if it was side or rear of hotel) and was very, very quiet. It was quite generous in size, and the bathroom was separated into two separate rooms. One room held the commode, with a large and spacious vanity area; the other room was another large vanity area with two sinks, and a large shower with wonderful hot-hot-hot water and terrific water pressure. The towels were fluffy, and they provided slippers and robes. To give an example of the impeccable service, I requested an iron and ironing board to touch up some clothing. I was told it would arrive in "one minute". In what seemed like 45 seconds, they were knocking at the door. I didn't stand there with a timer or anything, and cannot promise you it was less than one minute, but for sure I can tell you that the iron and ironing board arrived in less than 2 minutes! The same thing happened when I asked for a bucket of ice. Unfortunately, my husband and I were both taken ill on our last day in Barcelona. A few hours later, when we were not feeling better, we asked the concierge to send a doctor. Again, with impeccable service, the doctor was knocking on our door in less than 15 minutes. He prescribed medication, and within a few hours were on our way to recovery and were able to travel to London the next day as scheduled. The staff couldn't have been nicer - they didn't bother us while we were sick, and upon checkout inquired if we were feeling better, and expressed how sorry they were that we missed our last day of site seeing in Barcelona. The hotel is in a great location. It's walking distance, but away from the noise and craziness of Las Ramblas and the Boqueria. It is also walking distance from Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera. It is a cab ride away from Park Guell, which I highly recommend. I thought it would be "just a park", but it is so special and amazing! Park Guell is located on a hilltop, and even though I am a person that likes to walk, I opted for a cab as it was a warm day out. It is a long walk to get to the beach, but if you are a walker and if you are out and about exploring, then you will not find it to be that far. If you don't like to walk that much, then it is probably a quick cab ride to the beach.
UR112284645	We stayed in a deluxe double room at El Palace for four nights, and had a wonderful time. The staff were charming and attentive, the room spacious and beautifully furnished, and the bathroom (we didn't have one of the Roman baths) very elegant, with both a bath and rainwater shower. The public rooms are opulent and comfortable, with breakfast in the garden/conservatory a relaxed and tranquil affair, served until the supremely civilised hour of 11am - for anyone, like me, who's not a morning person, this is as good as it gets. The hotel is well situated for exploring Barcelona, just a couple of roads away from the shopping and street performers of La Rambla, and within easy walking distance of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo. It's a little further to the marina and beach, but still very easily walkable. Overall, El Palace is a gorgeous, romantic hotel, well worth the money. Can't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else in Barcelona.
UR112103359	Beautiful hotel, excellent product in room. Loved my Roman bath. The champagne in the grand lounge was excellent and the room itself fabulous. The new night club is uber cool. I had a small problem with the pillow menu. Requested a special pillow as I've a problem neck. Received it the first day, the second day it was taken from our room. Three pillows delivered to room later the second night we're all wrong. Finally got it back day 3. Ordered a car to the airport , the driver was 20 minutes late. We we're trying to phone the hotel when he finally showed up. For $117 Euro he should have been waiting at the airport. Small problems as hotel is fantastic, staff friendly and helpful!
UR111448778	This was one of the best place we stayed. Great staff. Very helpful with everything. Thanks a million.
UR111247263	Well what can I say, this hotel was perfect in every single way. I made the booking some months in advance as a surprise proposal for my now Fiancee. I emailed the hotel for assitance with champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and flowers for our room upon arrival and they were only too pleased to assist. They even gave us a guided tour of the hotel upon arrival. We were upgraded to a lovely room with a fantastic lighting system. The bathroom was very luxurious with all the added extras you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The mini-bar in the room was expensive, but to be fair they usually always are. Breakfast is a surcharge, so we decided to actually eat out. Barcelona is expensive, but it seems that most cities within the Euro zone are equally expensive. The hotel was perfectly located with only a short walk into the main centre. Do be aware though, that Sunday's are very quiet, with the majority of shops closed. Highly reccomended.
UR110151456	Lovely room, terrific bathroom, excellent customer service and Great Location.
UR109987660	We stayed at this hotel last week. The building, location and interior are fantastic. This was the former Ritz but apparently lost its Ritz status about 8 years ago, according to hotel staff. We had requested an upper floor. Upon check-in they upgraded us to a junior suite. The room was newly rennovated and fanstastic. Style, service and the rest was great. It is near the Passeig de Gracia street and metro stop so it is very convenient but out of the circus of La Rambla, etc. The issues we had are that the hotel is still trying to be the Ritz with its drink prices, etc. Mini bar items were between 5 and 15 euros. A chocolate bar was 15 euros. A beer in the bar was 8 euros. Just a bit out of touch for what it was. Second, the lights flickered on an off the first day we were there but stopped doing that for the rest of the stay. The shower pressure and temparture were horrible. It would go from normal to almost off then hot to cold every few seconds. Not in keeping with the beautiful rennovation on this bathroom. The biggest issue, and likely the cause of the loss of the Ritz name, is that the metro runs under the building. Many said it is not a big deal. We were on the top floor and could still hear/feel it. It felt like a mini earthquake every 15 minutes. I asked the reception about it and at first he said he didn't know what I was talking about then said it was the metro but it stopped at midnight. It does NOT stop at midnight. We heard/felt it all night long. Reception said it affects every room. Finally, watch the pickpockets, purse thieves and the (dishonest) cab drivers in Barcelona. They are everywhere. We saw a nicely dressed guy in a nice restaurant try to snatch a girls purse. When we were checking in one of the guest had been pickpockted on La Rambla. Two and perhaps 3 cab drivers tried to rip us off. One took us for a long ride and then dumped us at what he said was our stop. I got out and told him I would pay him once I verified. When he realized I had got him he sped away without us paying but leaving us stranded in a strange neighborhood. I speak spanish but they all pretend to get lost and take you accidently to the wrong place/hotel. So beware.
UR109954679	We stayed for three nights here. The location is good, if somewhat noisy. The room was fine, pretty large and had a fireplace with a TV in a mirror over it. A young lady found us as we were checking in and was very helpful in recommending restaurants, giving maps, etc. There were two negatives, however. There is no free WiFi in the rooms and if you use the business center (which is free) you only get an hour at a time. Then each time you want to go back, you need to get a new password from the desk. Very awkward. This was the only hotel on our trip that didn't offer free WiFi so they should fix this. The second neg was the breakfast. It is held in a room that is really outdoors and can be quite chilly in the morning. They do have heaters they can turn on if you ask. The hot items on their buffet were consistenly cold. Cold, runny eggs, cold bacon and sausage, etc. And don't go to their basement bar - the drinks are outrageous.
UR109824135	This was a trip to celebrate a special birthday for my partner, and this certainly turned out to be a special one!!! I contacted the hotel prior to departure from the UK, to order some champaign for the room on arrival, a massive surprise was waiting at check in, they had upgraded our room from a basic booking to a Junior Suite, and the champaign was on ice, in the room (Absolutely fantastic), this hotel is the most luxurious I have ever been in and our room was stunning due to its decor and comfort, the bathroom was out of this world! The staff are very friendly, all spoke english and very courteous and we were made to feel very welcome. The hotels location is only a short walk (10 minute or so) from all the transport links and La Rambla, and is located on one of the very beautiful tree lined streets a few minutes from Placa Catalunya. We had a wonderful stay, loved this hotel and its little personal touches. A very big thank you to the Hotel management and staff, for a wonderful stay.
UR109508161	Arrival is unimpressive - waiting 10 minutes for a porter to take up one's luggage is sloppy and having only two lifts make coming and going laborious - especially when staff use them as service lifts. The general impression is that the hotel is understaffed, reinforced by the room service number being eternally engaged. The room was a mess - dar, with heavy unmatched furnishings and cheap-looking built-out wardrobes. The bathroom was good but spoiled by a bidet mounted so close to the wall to be unusable. The breakfast is good but overall we were most disappointed, feeling that the hotel was better five years ago before the refurbishment. Altogether not worth five stars and not to be revisited.
UR108918224	Very friendly hotel, offering quality service and has a convenient location. Comfort rooms, pleasantly decorated and always thoroughly cleaned. A fairly wide selection of dishes for breakfast. Staff attentive and friendly. I would recommend this hotel for everyone`s stay in Barcelona, and gladly dwell in it in my next visit to this amazing city.
UR108341541	Good Location to give access to all parts of Barcelona. Superb room high above the traffic with soundproofing which really works! We may well have had the best room on the corner sharing a balcony with giant cherubs . Classy service and excellent (though not cheap) breakfast experience. The rain shower is as good as they say. About the only fault is the omission of complementary mineral water in the room.
UR107857082	outstanding service, most comfortable rooms with great bathrooms and excellent bedding, bathroom amenities could be less common. Incredible breakfast in the interior courtyard - Excellent Rolf MB Paris
UR107352695	We felt very much at home in this very luxurous hotel. The Reception was friendly & courteous. We were led to our room by the staff personally. Our Classic Delux room was large & very comfortable. The Bath-room was more than adequate & well fitted; the shower stall with the over-head rain shower was so heavenly that we could easily have spent the whole morning/evening inside.Breakfast was a delight in the covered Garden. And best of all was the free 24 hours daily wired high-speed internet service. The location of the hotel was very central with the shops & sights all within walking distance.We have no heasitation in recommending Le Palace Hotel to tourists visiting Barcelona.
UR105386993	I picked this hotel becaue of he reviews on Trip Advisor and it was prettty good. I'd recommend it and I'd probably stay here again. Price a bit high, but location and decor worth it!
UR105360013	I was a little daunted at first by the grandness & luxury of El Palace but within seconds I felt comfortable & relaxed due to the warm welcome of all members of staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Everything about the room was wonderful - the Roman Bath room is amazing! In spite of it's location at a busy junction, there was no traffic noise at all. El Palace is expensive, as you'd expect for a luxury hotel - but worth every euro.
UR105156359	The Hotel was comfortable, clean and Gorgeous! the Staff helped in finding local spots to eat and tips a nd direction on site seeing and night life. The recently renovated rooms with a victian like decor and madernized bathroom with a deep relaxing bath tub and rain fall shower. The Hotel has an amazing contnential breakfast , which happened to me incuded in my package. What a variety in breads, grains and pastries, basic eggs and beans and extensive savories in cured meats, cheeses and smoked salmon, fresh juices and (Cava) ,Champage. Really got me through the day of exploring the wide spead city. Also in the evning , althogh the drinks were a bit pricey ,the top shelf liquor and the craetive garnishes garnishes made them well worth in the amiance of the scotch bar! Beautiful decor and fabulous entertainment and an extremely central location , thumbs up times infinity!
UR104869202	El Palace is a genuine 5-star where everything is just right. Except maybe the bar downstairs who has drinks in a very high price range and is deserted for most of the time. Other than that, there isn't anything bad we could say about the place. My room was clean and nicely decorated, airport pick up worked out well and the service in the hotel is firs class. I recommend this hotel to everyone.
UR102969675	The building is lovely, the proportions, size and window light of all the rooms reminiscent of the hotel's hey day as the Ritz. There remain a great many glimpses of that greatness. The welcome on arrival, the grand foyer and the spendour of the Great lounge. In hotel of this quality - and frankly in a guest house of no quality - there is just no excuse for complete lack of hotel wifi. There is some sort of pay per access system. That of itself would be annoying when €2 on a room rate would leave them ahead of the game but it isn't just the money. The system available - even on their own PC's in the "business suite" - requires entering personal details including email address and a valid mobile number so that one can receive spam for years to come. Utterly hideous. And then there were just an array of little details betraying the fact that the owners of this grand old place simply don't have 5 star DNA. Some would be easy to overlook or forgive except that this hotel is brand new after a two year refit. So many silly little cost saving corners have been cut that the place is the shape of a football! The bathrooms have cheapest most hideous toilette tissue that no guest in this hotel will ever have in their home. King size beds (in all three of the rooms of our group) made up by pushing together two singles, Not just separate divans and separate mattresses but even the three inch thick mattress toppers were separate so that only the polycotton sheet joins them. Hiding the flat screen TV behind a mirror might have seemed like a swish way of maintaining a period look, but the TV maker uses a mirror and frame from B&Q which would never have graced a room in this hotel otherwise. Meanwhile the TV itself is so small in a postage stamp in the centre of the mirror so that subtitles are barely readable. No DVD player, no ipod connection, no radio, no usb connection. On the plus side there is a tremendous basement bar with live music which makes you feel you have stepped back 70 years. The food is is fine and served in decent quantity if not terribly exciting. The position is great and an easy walk to all the good bits of Barcelona (a fairly long walk to the beach but ok).
UR102705147	Loved, loved, loved this hotel. The room and the bathroom were very well appointed and incredibly beautiful. We received very personal service from everyone who worked at the hotel. Great dining recommendations from the concierge. We will definitely stay there again.
UR102627038	El Palace Hotel is by far the most elegant hotel that I have stayed at in Europe. The staff are committed to service. We were greeted upon arrival by Celine who showed us around the hotel and took us to our room. We had a Privilege Junior Suite with our 7-year-old. The suite offered a very large bedroom with flat screen TV, connecting sitting room with flat screen TV and an enormous bath - I mean HUGE! Double sinks, closets, separate tub and shower, plus separate water closet. The suite also had a separate half bath with sink and toilet which is great when you have a child with you on vacation. When we came back from sightseeing for a few hours after checking in, we were surprised to see a wonderful treat waiting for us - Cava, orange juice and a lovely cake - all of which we enjoyed after dinner at the hotel's casual restaurant. Plus they had made up a rollaway bed for our daughter and left her a lovely plush bear to take home. All in all, an excellent stay that we will always remember. FYI - make sure to go down to the new bar and try both the Mojito and Espresso Martini - they are THE BEST!
UR102429459	We spent 6 nights in this hotel and enjoyed every minute. Our room was comfortable, spacious, well laid out, bright and had windows overlooking the Gran Via. Little touches like the walk in wardrobe and bathroom separated from the bedroom by a passage were really thoughtful. We were on the third floor and yes, we could hear the metro rumble, but we didn't find it intrusive. The staff could not have been more helpful. If you are staying over a Sunday, the afternoon brunch is superb and well worth the price. The hotel is well located and most of the sights are within walking distance. We found the Metro really easy to use for getting to places like Park Guell
UR102324034	My only suggestion is to use coffee jars for filter coffee in each table with the essential milk at the breakfast rather than waiting the staff to refill your cup .
UR102251496	But with the updated comforts of home...maybe even better! A short walk from the Plaza Catalunya...we found the staff ready to cater to us in ever way. From the doorman to the concierge to housekeeping...top service! Turn down service with chocolates to booking our tours...wonderful service abounds. The room we were given was just magnificent...over looking the Gran Via Corts. The room more than lived up to expectations with all the amenities. Starting with the room lighting...fantastic. Sensors for lights on the hallway turns on automatically, the size of the room and elegant style but the best part was the bathroom. With forest rain shower effect that will pamper anyone. We have stayed in many luxury hotels and this hotel is in the lines of the St. George Palace Hotel in Athens and Luna Bagliolini in Venice or even the Grand Hotel Europe in St. Petersburg. The noise from the tram is a minor nuisance and the room can use coffee makers...but that's all we can think of that can make the stay greater. Coming from Belgium prior to Barcelona where we stayed at Royal Windsor Hotel by the Grand Place...this hotel wins by a mile. Warm staff, wonderful hotel, beautiful city...makes a perfect ending to a fantastic European vacation.
UR102185043	We stayed here for 5 nights with our 16 year old daughter who was finishing up an exchange program in Barcelona. The staff went out of its way to make sure we had an enjoyable stay - - you could tell that they are knocking themselves out to bring back the old Ritz glamour and hospitality and it shows. We booked the Junior Privilege Suite and it was perfect for the three of us, king bed, nice sitting area, and a high quality rollaway that was set up for our daughter and made up with all the best linens. We loved the huge dressing room/closet that gave everyone privacy. The piece de resistance; however, was the bathroom which was the largest we've ever had in Europe. Enormous tub, separate walk in shower, large enough for four people with two overhead showerheads and two hand held shower nozzles, L'Occitane bath products, loofah sponges, thick towels, bathrobes, slippers - the works. And a good size toilet area within the bathroom but containing a heavy high quality door for privacy. Could not have asked for anything else. Reading lights everywhere and accessible. Motion detector light that went on and off in case you had to use the bathroom at night. Large screen tv with a swivel. We had a back room so it was also very quiet. And there is simply no better location - - we walked all over the city from our hotel with ease. My daughter's host family, who have lived in Spain for generations, confirmed this - - saying they couldn't imagine a better located hotel. All in all a wonderful place!
UR101673216	Stayed there for three nights in March and had a great time. Rooms were top quality as is to be expected at a property of this level. The period theme of the property makes it very pretty. The included breakfast had a lot of variety. It's within walking distance of Las Ramblas - the main tourist drag, the port area and also the old city. Staff was polite and extremely helpful. The only caveat is that they don't offer unpaid wi-fi which I find puzzling since they provide ethernet access included in the hotel room price. Other than that, I have no complaints about the hotel.
UR101483499	Pros Great, elegant, lovely hotel at a reasonable rate. Rooms were great; spacious with a huge bed, walk in wardrobe and a small balcony. Nice bathroom and no problems with the shower temperature. Location was good being close to the main square (Catalunya) and a few Metro stations. The staff were friendly and helpful. Cons I asked for a room on a high floor away from the lift and noise of metro. Unfortunately none of these requests were adhered to. To be fair I didn't kick up a fuss as we had a room looking out onto the street, with a balcony. Food in the hotel is very expensive (28 Euro for breakfast I think) and unfortunately the noise from the Metro can be pretty annoying at times.
UR101448395	We were spoiled rotten by El Palace from the moment we arrived. Everyone is delightful, kind, thoughtful, helpful, and VERY willing to make the extra effort on your behalf. We had a dinner reservation one night at a VERY obscure restaurant (La Luna-you MUST go!) and ad Con Gracia (don't even think about NOT going!) and even the door man made the extra effort to explain to the cab driver where in the world we were going in Barcelona. The concierge were equally as helpful and the rooms, beds, bathrooms, were all exactly as one could hope for. The biggest plus - AFTER the incredibly attentive service - is the perfect location!! Don't hesitate to stay here - you won't be disappointed!!!
UR101379447	beautiful lobby, beautiful guest rooms, beautiful terrace for breakfast, excellent and attentive staff, perfect location, short walk to all major tourist sites, bottle of sparkly in room on arrival, perfect way to start a vacation!
UR101036564	Beautiful hotel, impeccable service and friendly staff made our stay for my husband's 40th wonderful. We booked 2 nights here and 2 nights in the AbAC hotel - wish we had booked the full 4 nights here. Love the coctail bar with Live band playing at 10.30 and 12.30 - so perfect way to end an evening out. Stunning lounge and breakfast rooms - we pushed the boat out and had breakfast there just once - 30 Euros each! - pleasant enough but was likewarm - but tasty. Overall if I go to Barcelona again - I would definately choose this hotel - cash permitting. Not the cheapest place to stay - but worth every penny in my book. Location is very good - walkable to Cathedral, Las Ramblas and Placa Cataluna etc so a very good base if you want to walk to some of the sights. Overall excellent hotel.
UR100935172	This hotel is luxurious and beautiful and in a great location. The staff are friendly and the hotel is good value. We booked more than a month in advance on booking.com and got a great room for €140 the first night and €160 the second night which is amazing value for a 5 star hotel. The place has L'Occitane toiletries and cool mirrors that double as TVs. My only complaints are that the beds are hard and the pillows aren't great, and the guys at the check-in desk were not very friendly. One of them even took a personal call on his mobile phone while he was checking us in. He didn't really greet us or seem welcoming. But the rest of the staff were very nice. We will stay there again when we come to Barcelona!**Just make sure you stay on a high floor since the Metro runs underneath the hotel and rumbles a lot
UR100263929	We stayed six nights at El Palace last week on our first trip to Barcelona. It was truly a five star hotel experience. The hotel has been recently redone in opulent style. The lobby and other common spaces, including a majestic courtyard to take breakfast on (although we wished this was open all day, especially in the afternoon), are just gorgeous. The highlight though was our room. We were upgraded at check-in to a junior suite. It was a large room, luxury linens, seating area, desk. We loved. But the bathroom is worth it's own review! European bathrooms usually leave a lot to be desired, but this one was quite large and had the most wonderful walk-in shower with a bench and four showerheads. Wish they'd have free wireless in the room, but they gave us a cable which was fine. Great location, great hotel, we'll be back!
UR100201132	We stayed in a Privilege Junior Suite. Unfortunately, we only had two nights to spend in Barcelona, but this hotel made it very enjoyable. The Junior Suite was lovely with a fabulous bathroom including a separate shower and toilet room, whirlpool tub and walk-in closet. The hotel was conveniently located for sight-seeing, and the staff was helpful and friendly. We also highly recommend dinner at the Michelin-starred Caelis and drinks in the jazz club/bar on the lower level. Would definitely stay here again.
UR99425756	First time in Barcelona we initially planned to stay at a regular hotel, but when booking I did a search for a historical hotel in Barcelona and hit El Palace. The price was reasonable and the location looked great so it wasn't a hard decision. So with great expectations, we walked from the train to the hotel. (Easy to find, short walk) Would this be a hotel like the Grand Plaza in Rome ? (In that hotel we recieved fantastic service simply by smiling and being polite to all of the staff - I know a lot of people has another experience) But this was even better. Smaller, but in every other way better. We did anyway smile to everyone and got lots in return. We almost felt like a part of a big family after a few days. Well, some facts now. A room of proper size, not big, but big enough. French balcony and a big luxurious bath. No noise from the street outside. The location was, as expected perfect. We used our legs almost all the time. Almost everything was within walking distance, from La Rambla to La Sagrada Familia. So why just almost perfect ? Well....I have a back which due to a small injury needs a medium to soft matress, and when it is as hard as they were at El Palace I can't sleep more than a couple of hours before it hurts. Knowing how to deal with my back I asked for an extra thin matress on the top. The concierge said that this was no problem, but when the maid came (Probably the head-maid, she was the archtype of a spanish grandmother :) she said that it was not possible to do this. I tried to tell her that it was just to.......but got just No-No-No in return. Hard luck... I didn't want this to ruin an in every other way perfect week, so I tried to ignore it, and after three more nights I probably got used to it, and managed to sleep all night. Do we want to go back ? In Barcelona yes. But for the best hotelbed in the world, try The Peninsula in NY.
UR97924195	We stayed in February for 3 nights and our stay was absolutely outstanding. The service was impeccable. The concierge could not have been more helpful in organizing excursions for us, suggesting and making reservations at restaurants, and recommending what to see. We had been to Barcelona before so we wanted to see things we had not seen before. The rooms were gorgeous and the lobby sitting room was magnificent. The location was ideal. Easy walking to all areas. I would highly recommend this hotel to all.
UR97429033	As with every hotel afilliated with the "Leading Hotels of the World" chain that I have stayed in, I found the Palace entirely satisfactory. Its location is ideal, centrally located between the old town and the bustling Eixample, giving easy access to both the medieval core and the modern city. The gothic cathedrals and the twentieth century Gaudi and Montaner houses are all within a short, pleasant stroll; Sagrada Familia is a convenient subway ride away. As for the hotel itself, the staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful, always had at least adequate English, and fulfilled every request. The hotel cultivates a (perhaps inauthentic, but nevertheless pleasing) old-world charm, with a grand lobby, doormen in snappy uniforms, and much bowing and scraping. The building is elegant and our room, while not enormous, was adequate, with an excellent view, a large and comfortable bathroom with double sinks, a good shower, and superior sound buffering. Last but not least, the Palace offered what may be the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on.
UR96271306	I stayed here in February 2011 for three nights. Staff was friendly and gave me the right advice about places to visit and to eat in the city. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I have to say that the bath wasn’t that comfortable and the hot water on the shower wasn’t keeping the water temperature stable. Also from the room you can hear the underground trains passing by, but none of these was a major issue. I would recommend this hotel.
UR95713281	We spent a week here last month and were very pleased with our stay. Perhaps because January is not the busy tourist season for Barcelona, the rates were very reasonable for such a luxurious hotel. We paid 205 euros a night for a "Classic Deluxe" with a king bed. I just looked at the hotel's web site and it seems to be showing even cheaper rates for February. The room we stayed in was absolutely gorgeous, having been recently renovated. It had beautiful fabrics, carpet, and wall-coverings, and very good sound proofing. The hotel is on a corner, the intersection of two busy streets. We were on the fifth floor overlooking Carrer Roger de Lluria. All we had to do was close the window and the traffic noise was gone. The vintage building has been outfitted with steel framed, double-glazed windows that seal tightly and very effectively block the street noise. However, the best part of the room was the beautiful, spacious, completely redone bathroom. It had a tub, a separate walk-in shower, and a large countertop with two sinks. The toilet was in a separate compartment with a sliding frosted glass door. Compared to the usual cramped and inconvenient European bathrooms that I'm used to encountering, this place was superb. They even included a beautiful, live (not plastic!) orchid sitting on the countertop in the bathroom. The room was really more like what I usually find in a high-end American resort than in an urban hotel in Europe. I have stayed in rooms in Europe comparable to this one, but they typically cost two to three times as much as this. The staff of the hotel could not have been more gracious or accommodating. The reception desk personnel, concierge, and door man were all very welcoming and helpful. Guests have to deal with concierge frequently because your room key needs to be turned in to the concierge every time you leave the hotel. The rooms keys here are attached to a large fabric tassel that you don't want to carry in your pocket. I haven't encountered this for years in a big city in Europe, but here you leave your key with the desk when you step out of the hotel. The locks on the rooms seem to be some kind of fancy electronic system, but there aren't any of the usual plastic key cards. it all worked fine though and there was always someone at the concierge desk when you needed your key. The staff at breakfast in the Garden were also very pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast was pricey -- 28 euros -- but the elaborate buffet was great. There were hot scrambled eggs, lavish Spanish hams and cheeses, fresh-squeezed fruit juices, and a huge array of fresh pastries. The "Garden" is sort of a large tented space that is heated with propane heaters when it's chilly. It's a beautiful space with a glass wall at the end of it overlooking a small outdoor area with a fountain. We enjoyed the breakfast so much that we went every day during our stay, despite the cost. I noticed another posting that mentioned problems with the elevators. Both guest elevators were out of service at one point during our stay. The staff did a very good job of seeing that everyone was promptly escorted to a service elevator in a staff area of the hotel to go upstairs. It wasn't too much of problem for us, but for a traveler with mobility challenges, it could be a big problem. The service elevators are a long walk from the lobby and it's up a half flight of stairs and down a another half-flight to get there. It did appear that you could access the service elevators from a street entrance without having to negotiate any stairs, although we never did that. Interestingly, free WiFi was available in the lobby and using an ethernet connection in the room was also free. The front desk will provide you with an ethernet cord if you need one. However, WiFi in the room was only available at a stiff price. I was traveling with an iPad that can only use a WiFi connection, so I just succumbed and paid a ridiculous 40 euros for every 72 hours of WiFi service in the room. Unfortunately, this hotel's website, like most hotel websites, provides no useful details about internet service. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and would absolutely stay here again. We've already recommended the hotel to a friend who is planning a visit to Barcelona and we hope to return next winter.
UR95454954	on average an excellent hotel with very nice rooms, very professional staff ( kind, polite and efficient) and the best breakfast i found in Barcelona. Really a very good hotel to recommand and thanks to all the staff .
UR94767351	This hotel was intended as a one night splurge after our cruise. It did not disappoint. I had been sick on the cruise so we asked for a room with two toilets. They upgraded us to a fabulous suite. The service was attentive, especially because the elevators were both under repair and we had to use the service elevator. We were there on a Sunday, and nothing is open. There was no soup to be found within a 7 block radius of the hotel. So the hotel made up chicken soup for me! While it was pricey, it hit the spot. If you like a hotel with an old world atmosphere, great service, and can afford the prices, this is the place to stay! All that and free internet too!
UR94358813	Went with fiancée for 3 nights. From the time of check-in it felt like a great holiday. The room was large & modern. Very comfortable bed. Large and spacious bathroom. Got a nice view of the main street from the window. Location couldn't have been better. Service was impeccable from all the staff. Concierge recommended wonderful restaurants and shops. Very well placed out business center with free internet. Truly felt like staying in a grand palace.
UR93379012	This hotel is the former Ritz in Barcelona and has been well-restored. The rooms are beautiful (though the TV positioning a bit odd), and the bathrooms are large and clean. The lunch food we had was delicious. The staff are extremely attentive, and always willing to help you navigate Barcelona or find a restaurant. You truly feel like the only guest in what is a rather large hotel.
UR92725408	We stayed at El Palace for a week and generally had a very enjoyable experience. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, though drawer space in our walk-in closet was almost non-existent. Our third floor windows completely shut out the noise from the main avenue right outside. The hotel retains the very lavish and ornate style of its Ritz heritage so be prepared for that kind of opulent decor. The service was generally as one would expect, but if you've stayed at other top hotels in the world, especially in Asia, you'll notice it's very much of the European variety, i.e. efficient and courteous but without a sense of genuine warmth. The concierge in particular suffered from this. Food was good and we had a wonderful meal at Caelis (although the cavernous dining room borders on a ballroom feeling). Prices are as you would expect in a five star European hotel, and we ate breakfast elsewhere most mornings. We found the location to be excellent. It's close to the centre of things and in an upmarket area of town, far enough away from the tourist hotspots. Comments by other reviewers are worth noting. The rumble from the metro line directly below is quite noticeable but didn't bother us too much. Yes, our shower also ran hot and cold, and we found that the bath water wasn't especially hot (this improved after we mentioned it to them). Pillows are strange, as the standard issue appears to be a kind of lumpy bolster - not what you'd expect in a five star. There is a 'pillow menu', which we asked for and managed to obtain soft down and feather ones. But this menu was nowhere apparent in our room - odd if you make a point of having such a thing. It's little points like this which can be faulted at El Palace - there's nothing seriously wrong, but they need to pay a little more attention to some of the small details before they will rank among the top players internationally.
UR89856283	Great hotel with superb lobby and salon. Rooms and bathrooms are very comfortable and luxurious. The shower is simply great !!! The hotel is very well located, close to most attractions in Barcelona. Food and room service are great, expensive but great. Worth the fare if you want a top quality experience. Hotel personnel knows about top dinning and is willing to help you with reservations.
UR88526024	We thoroughly enjoyed staying at El Palace Hotel. The staff always treated us very well. The lobby is beautifully furnished. The rooms were spacious and luxurious. The bathroom was quite large with a toilet room, 2 sinks, a tub, and separate shower. Everything was clean and well kept. Our room was on the 4th floor and was very quiet. The hotel is in a great location. Very easy to walk to Las Ramblas & Gaudi's houses. The hotel is Old World luxury with modern amenities. Very nice! We would definitely stay here again.
UR85994853	Recently stayed at the Palace. Beautiful hotel. Paid a few euro extra over other five star hotels and well worth it. Definitely Five Star Grand Lux. Entire hotel was recently redone and they did an excellent job of keeping the old world luxury and blending modern conveniences. Staff was friendly and helpful although restaurant suggestions were not that great. Better off using Trip Advisor. Room was spacious, immaculate, washroom was clean and modern. I suggest having breakfast (it's expensive!!) at least once in the dining area. If the day is mild, they open the doors and it is wonderful. The bar at night is a great area to unwind with a drink before calling it a night. The room was very quiet. We did hear the train but it was not an issue and did not affect our sleep. Much happier that staying on Las Ramblas. Close to everything.
UR85953450	Confirm other's reviews - spacious bathrooms, quality fixtures and fittings, calm tradionally furnished rooms. Pictures on the website are accurate. Excellent location. We were on the first floor and although we did 'feel' rather than hear the metro it didn't seem frequent and certainly did not disturb us. The public areas seemed little used - prices heavy, more so than a usual 5*.
UR85800444	This is a lovely hotel. The staff are very friendly and attentive. it's a pleasure to return to after a day of sightseeing. Very well located and good value too.
UR85698397	Just spent 4 nights at the Palace. Room was great but the street noise was terrible. The windows did nothing to shut out the noise and the worse thing was the hotel sits on top of the Metro. You hear the rumble of the trains all night. It is like the train stops and starts under your bed. When I went to check out they wanted to charge me a different rate than what was on my printout. They had much discussion of this. They tried to tell me it was my fault that the rates were wrong. I told them that it was their website printout not mine. The gentleman was mad and threw my papers over on another desk. He blamed me for not telling her before check out......What? However he did only charge me the rate that was on my printout. We travled all over Spain and this was the most expensive hotel and our least favorite.
UR84830382	The Palace Hotel definitely stands out among the numerous contemporary, chic hotels with minimalistic aesthetics. The lobby and the rooms are elegant and romantic, and equipped with all sorts of modern amenities. The decor was elaborate but tasteful, evoking old world glamour. While the room we had wasn't particularly big, the bathroom (double vanity, separate tub and shower) and the walk-in closet were so spacious that it felt like a mini-suite. The garden in which breakfast was served was lovely as well - bright, airy and beautifully furnished.
UR84760790	Lovely elegant hotel. Great location on Gran Via as others have mentioned. Definitely their greatest asset is the staff....all very kind and accomodating. Spacious room but the bed was not the most comfortable and the pillows were very hard....causing sore necks & heads each morning. When asked for a softer pillow none were to be had......and no attempt to get one. ...a variety would help. Very quiet location which is great after a day of sight-seeing. However the bar and lounge area were empty each night of our 3 days there. We would have liked to have relaxed there for a nightcap after our great dinners out but it just felt so desolate in the lounge. No doubt it was empty due to the outrageous drink prices. We've had cocktails all over Europe as well as all across North America...from N.Y. to Chicago to L.A. and Vancouver to Toronto but these were the most extreme prices.
UR84653732	We stayed here at the start of our Spain/Portugal trip with daughters aged 9 and 11. The location is great - good, safe neighborhood, close to the Placa Cataluyna, easy walk to the Gaudi masterpieces, Gothic quarter, and everything else. We requested: connecting rooms, high floor, away from elevator, breakfast included, and a ride from the airport. All were attended to perfectly. Our rooms were very large and connected as requested. Check-in was efficient and helpful. The concierge made a reservation for us at El Gran Cafe, per my request. The beds were very comfortable. Although the hotel is on a busy street, our room was very quiet due to excellent soundproofing. The second night, the concierge recommended a restaurant called Windsor, which was a taxi ride (we could have walked, but it's a longer walk). The food was excellent - and they were very helpful about modifying the items for kids' palates (our kids eat fairly adventurously, but things like ensuring fries as the side went over very well!). We ate lunch in the hotel restaurant one day - I wouldn't recommend this. The food was good, but it was rather expensive and I think we would have done just as well to explore on our own. It was convenient, however! The breakfast was very good - many choices of foods and beverages. The room in which they serve breakfast is lovely. The hotel doormen and bellmen were great about getting taxis, loading our suitcases, and so forth.
UR84575655	This hotel is a great place and it is realy five star hotel. We stayed there for a weekend in April, it was gift for my girlfriends birthsday. We had wonderful stay in this hotel and Barcelona is a beautiful city.
UR84136189	This is one of the best, if not the best, hotel we have ever stayed in. Everything was perfect - service, staff, assistance, cleanliness, location, bar, restaurant .
UR84096747	We reserved El Palace for our last night of our tour of Spain. I had read that the hotel had just completed a renovation, which is what I always look for in hotels (new always trumps worn). What I didn't realize is that El Palace used to be the Ritz, so the renovation went all out luxury. Before I describe the room, etc., I should say that this hotel is extremely well situated, just a few blocks from the Gaudi buildings and the Passeig de Gracia. You can easily walk to everything from here. For no reason at all, we were upgraded to a junior suite, which was one of the most spectacular rooms we have stayed in. The king-sized bed had the requisite fine crisp sheets, ample pillows, and super comfortable mattress. The room was large enough to have a love seat, coffee table, and two chairs for relaxing in. Blackout silk drapes assured total darkness over large soundproof windows (that opened!), but the most sophisticated lighting system I have seen in a hotel room assured plenty of light at night. The suite had a huge closet/cloakroom with a full length mirror and tons of storage. The limestone clad bathroom was so spacious and perfectly clean and new, I could have lived in it. Two sinks, a jacuzzi tub, toilet in its own stall, and a huge shower, with double rain-head showers, a long bench and two handheld showers created all this comfort. What luxury! In the morning, the breakfast was delicious (as it was all over Spain). However, I have to give special kudos to the pastry chef. I am a food writer specializing in bread, and had some of the best chocolate croissants I have ever eaten. Also, the bread in Spain tends toward mediocrity (why?), so I was delighted to finally get some delicious crispy, very fresh, whole wheat rolls. The buffet was served in the garden room, with a full array of juices, cured meats and fish, fruit, hot beverages, English breakfast items like baked beans, eggs, and sausages, and of course that incredible bakery. Completing this experience was of course a very professional and competent staff. Did I say that our room was under 250 euro? How is this deal possible with this level of luxury and service?
UR83274311	Just returned from a long weekend at the Palace hotel. It was wonderful, can't fault it. The public areas were opulent, the rooms extremely comfortable - our bathroom was fantastic- and the service was tremendous. The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend this hotel!
UR83274245	Let me state the obvious right away – this is not a cheap hotel, but you cannot beat the value you get for your money. We stayed in a number of 5-star hotels on our trip, and Barcelona’s El Palace was undoubtedly the best. We were traveling with a child, and we were driving so we had a a car which can be quite a problem in Barcelona. From the moment we pulled in front of El Palace, the hotel staff took care of us every step of the way! Instead of having us deal with messy narrow underground parking in Barcelona, they parked the car for us every time, and took it out on moments notice. The moment they noticed we’re with a small child (4 year old) they upgraded us to a junior suite. Room was wonderful – quiet and spacious, clean and modern, with jet bath and rain shower, and with an extra bed set up for our boy. Waiting for us was complimentary Cava (Spanish bubbly), and each day on our return to the room we found chocolates which only made every day even better! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful on every step, including making friends with our kid. And lastly, restaurant and scotch bar are hard to beat. You may have heard that in Barcelona you should stay on La Rambla. Take my advice – do NOT stay there! It is one huge tourist trap, with bad and overprices restaurants, and really nothing you should see... ever. You should explore Barri Gotic and Born areas (which BTW, has some of the best restaurants), and Ports, but stay away from La Rambla. El Palace is located on large street, so easy to find, but a few blocks detached from over-touristy and over-crowded La Rambla. You’re only two blocks (5 mins on foot) away from Plaza Catalunia and from entrance into Passeig de Gracia, which has both attractions (Gaudi’s houses), great restaurants, and great shopping. Metro station is very close to hotel, so you’re also close to wherever else you want to get to. Even better, taxis in Barcelona are dirt cheap and getting from and to El Palace is trivial, and you won’t have to suffer and pay for stop’n’go crawling through La Rambla. Overall, quality of service as well as hotel and room quality made our stay in El Palace absolutely wonderful, and we highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona. Next time we come to Barcelona, we are definitely coming back to El Palace!
UR83056449	Feel free to book this hotel, it was a real positive experience. I would have to say that the staff were the most outstanding feature. Almost everyone was bilingual and easy to communicate with. The concierge staff were the best, offering directions, making reservations etc. The room was large and clean with a recently renovated, large bathroom. I loved the location on the Grand Via. It was a 2 - 4 block walk to many desirable spots be they the metro, the Placa de Catalunya or the Bus Turistica. I appreciated that the location was near enough to be convenient but not directly in the busy, noisy main drag. If I had to say anything negative, it would be that the breakfast is way over priced but there are numerous breakfast bars within 1 to 2 blocks of the hotel.
UR83041959	The hotel was completely renovated in 2008. The rooms are new, spacious and very comfortable. There is a closet inside the bedroom and the bathroom is quite large. All the equipments (TV, bath, etc) are new and very modern. No doubt a 5 star hotel that deserves this category. I definitely recommend it.
UR82413827	From the time we stepped out of our car, the service was fabulous. Everyone we dealt with during our stay was friendly and helpful. We had heard great things about the Concierge and they lived up to the high bar that had been set. The rooms were very comfortable and VERY quiet, which made for a good night's sleep.
UR81682904	We booked this based on the 2009 upgrade to the hotel, which is impressive. It's a classic 5 star hotel in the same vein as the Ritz in Madrid, where we also stayed. Good location, nice rooms, absolutely the worst Wi-Fi I have ever encountered in 10 years of travel. It's out of the dark ages. They partner with a company called Kubli, which while helpful, denied my payment on a limitless AMEX card, through their help line, finally got me connected, since "they don't work well with FireFox (??)", and the connection speed then dropped from the standard 54mbps to 8! I fetched an Ethernet cable from the Consierge, which was free, and here I am. Also there are no down comforters on the bed and the pillows feel like they are made of kapok (for you young-uns, look it up). Other than that, it was an enjoyable two night experience. I will not be back.
UR81494748	This hotel is definitely worth a visit. The room was lovely (large double with roman bath) and the main hotel areas are also quite grand and very elegant. This is not a contemporary hotel (our usual choice), but was a very nice change and had all the modern comforts, but with a touch of old class. My only gripe about the hotel was the bar / waiting staff in the main lounge. We waited quite a while to order a drink and in the end gave up as we were ignored until we moved seats. The drinks were also very expensive, and are way above even top London prices. I would recommend this hotel, but find a nearby bar for drinks.
UR81390419	We stayed at the Palace from Sept. 8-12. Fantastic. Amazing buffet breakfast with meats, eggs, cereal, yogurt, fruits, and of course sparkling wine. (28 Euro per person). Staff was friendly and prompt. The room was great. Very comfortable bed. The Roman bath was a really fun twist. Location is close to shopping, great restaurants and a short walk to Las Ramblas. This was our 4th trip to Barcelona and we would deffinately go back to the Palace. It truely is beautiful and a top notch hotel.
UR81126031	We had a great stay! Our request for adjoining rooms on a high floor were provided without a fuss. The weather was very hot during our stay and the AC worked well. The rooms were spacious and clean. The service and quality of appointments were synonomous with other "Leading Hotels of the World." The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of offerings; the champagne mimosa was especially delicious. Rather than using the expresso machine, I recommend you ask for fresh coffee with hot milk. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Gaudi houses and Catalunya Plaza. High speed internet is free using an ethernet provided cable. The flat screen TV is behind the mirror and there are rain fall showers, separate tubs, and sound proofed walls. Ask for a balcony room on the bloulevard side and in the distance, you can see the spires of La Sagrada de Familia.
UR80446136	We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. Hospitable staffs and their sophisticated services supported our pleasant stays. Especially, hotel concierge arranged our tickets for flamenco show very speedy and precisely under our request. If we stayed in Barcelona next time, we would choose this hotel.
UR79768572	On my first visit in a few years, I found the former Ritz in great shape after an almost completed and superb renovation. The location is close to all the major sites but away from the crowds of the Ramblas. As other reviewers have noted, you can sometimes feel that the underground is passing under the hotel but this was not a major issue. The rooms are large, luxurious and very nicely refurbished. The bathroom with Roman bath (and a large separate rain shower) is one of my favourites anywhere. The public areas have been refreshed, and lunch next to the hall bar was very good. The other bar will open only in a few months. Breakfast is a 5-star buffet served in a beautiful covered garden and an experience not to be missed (unusually good service). The Palace is definitely the best option in Barcelona (I checked out the new Mandarin Oriental for a drink in the garden, and I was shocked by the poor service). With a good fitness / spa / pool, the Palace could be among the best European city hotels.
UR79677415	This is a great hotel and will make all the difference to your stay in Barcelona. The style is Old World opulence but with all the modern amenities. The staff were all very helpful. Nothing even slightly negative to say. Have at least one drink at the bar and breakfast out on the patio.
UR78876167	I booked two nights at this hotel because I couldn't get into the Hilton Diagonal Mar (where I've stayed before). What a choice! This now officially becomes the best hotel I've ever stayed at. I've been into the Paris Ritz before and this place is more luxurious! It would be a £500 night hotel if it was in Paris or London, I couldn't believe the value that I got. Service was top class, food was excellent and the room was sensational, spotlessly clean with walk in showers, chandeliers and a mirror that becomes a TV which I've never seen anywhere before - a bit gimmicky maybe but very clever. The dining room is magnificent as is the bar area - its pricy in the bar but to be expected really. The location in the centre of the town is great, of course you are away from the beach and there is no pool, although the beach isn't too far away. If you're in Barca for sightseeing or business you really can't do better. One tip - there is more than one Palace Hotel in Barcelona - in fact I think there are three - so write the address down and show it to the taxi driver before he sets off as you could end up at the wrong address - as I did on one occasion.
UR78721570	The service was impeccable! There was not even one exception. Everybody was so professional, helpful and polite! Special mention to Alexis the multilingual concierge guy. From the moment we stepped in, he was so courteous, discreet, professional really the perfect person to be there! All porters have also been so polite. Breakfast is one of the best we’ve ever had in a 5 star hotel. The breakfast area is gorgeous! The hotel location is just perfect, most of Barcelona sights area short and pleasant walk away. I cannot rate this hotel with less than 5 stars even though there are clearly some parts of the hotel which are not finished yet… I think that by the end of the year when the jazz bar will open it will be so nice! One think to keep in mind if you want to visit other cities around Barcelona, is that the hotel does not have good deals with car rental companies so they are charging too much. The good thing is that 200 m down the road there is a europcar office and we rented a nice small car for 25 euros per day!
UR77981716	Though they are still in the middle of refurbishment, we did not notice/hear anything. We booked Classic room, but got upgraded to Junior suite. Spa was not ready in August 2010, so that was a slight minus. Reception, bell persons are very helpful, though we found concierge staffs are incredibly arrogant. No internet access in the room. Drainage problems with the bathtub. We think they have still a lot to finalise, but overall our stay was comfortable.
UR76246842	The Palace is a great location for reaching the La Ramblas and the Gaudi sites. The hotel is beautifully renovated with a lovely sitting room off the lobby, spacious bedrooms, comfortable bedding, and perfectly appointed bath including a great rain shower. It served as an oasis after a full day of touring and its staff could not be more accommodating. If you need any help with directions or local eateries make sure you talk to David, the doorman, who greets you each day with a perfect smile and helping hand. What a wonderful place to stay…we will be back!
UR76132807	This hotel is splendid. Gorgeous rooms, stunning lobby. Very ornate, so if you like a sleek modern look it is not the place for you. Concierge staff is FABULOUS. Perfect location. Much quieter than the Las Ramblas. Just perfect.
UR76098412	Stayed for 3 nights. Taxi drivers always got confused because there are so many hotels in the area with "Palace" in it's name. Just make sure you tell them the address. Not so many drivers know it was the former Ritz Hotel either. Hotel is almost done with the renovation. The Reception desk area was just finishing when I was checking out (temporary desk was set next to the concierge before). But no issues with the service, it was all excellently run. Concierge helped me before and during my stay and offered great advice and service. Room was large and kept clean. Showers, tub, faucets and everything run well (and brand new just after the renovation). Even though the building is old, no need to be scared of a century old plumbing system as in other European old 5 star hotels. Nice large bed too. The subway seems to run right underneath the hotel and made some noise/rumble every time it passed under us, but was not such a nuisance. Much better than police car sirens and car alarms that go off every 10 minutes in NY or other large cities. Staff were excellent in all areas, maybe because they are former Ritz employees? You can easily spot top level skill and pride among the staff in an excellent hotel, and it's evident here at El Palace. Just one thing. The TV in the framed mirror is a nice idea, but it sporadically seems to freeze up when trying to change the channel. Maybe the reception or the remote is not so good? But I like the idea because it keeps the room in line with the elegant, classic atmosphere of the hotel.
UR73500383	I have stayed at many hotels throughout the world but never at "The Palace." The recent renovation of the hotel was very well done, our rooms was spacious, the bathroom wonderful,(my wife's description) and the decor was very tastefully done. It is the type of elegant hotel that I adore and would highly recommend it for anyone. It was within easy walking distance of many attractions as well as shopping. On my return to Barcelona, it will be my preferred place to stay
UR73008856	The El Palace hotel is a spectacular hotel in Barcelona Spain that gives you an experience of a life time. I was sincerely impressed with the service and helpfulness of the staff. Everybody was always asking if they could do something for us or weather we were okay. If you are going to go to Barcelona make sure you stay at the El Palace hotel. If you are travelling with kids and you get everyone in one room ask for joining rooms as well as a view no matter what type of room you are staying in.
UR72433774	Our stay at El Palace was wonderful. It is a short walk from Las Ramblas and the shopping district. It is near a few Metro stations, making it easy to navigate Barcelona. It was a bit pricier than other options, and for this reason, I would probably stay in a less expensive hotel on future visits. That being said, the hotel room was large, with a spacious walk-in closet and large, renovated bathroom. (I don't know what I'd find elsewhere). We chose this hotel b/c of the positive reviews and we were celebrating our honeymoon, so decided to "splurge". We were not disappointed at all, the service was exceptional, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was great. Highly recommend this hotel.
UR72309456	Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in July. Had also considered staying at the Mandarin Oriental and the Hotel Arts, but was so pleased to have chosen this hotel. As you will have read the hotel has been recently refurbished. Our bedroom (standard king) was beautiful and finished to a top luxury standard, with heavy doors, plush seats and a fantastic bathroom. Loved the walk in rain shower, excellent water pressure. Room was large, with a walk in wardrobe and long entry corridor. Bathrobes provided. Excellent Loewe TV with good selection of channels. Soundproofing was excellent and we could not hear any noise from the corridor or other rooms. Lovely small balcony which we could stand on. The public areas are equally beautiful, with a huge luxurious bar/reception room. Excellent service here and throughout the hotel. We didn't try breakfast due to the cost (32 Euros/person). There main restaurant looked fantastic and I believe it has a Michelin star. Free internet available in the rooms. I am sure once they complete all the renovations (I believe they are building a pool and second bar) this hotel will be the best in Barcelona.
UR69997434	Newly renovated in exquisite taste, with a very convenient location and excellent personalized service, El Palace is a gem. Our room was absolutely comfortable, roomy, with a lovely view of the city. My husband and I are frequent travelers, both for business and pleasure. Seldom do we encounter such a lovely hotel. Will definitely come back next time we are in Barcelona.
UR69371778	Excellent location, large room with great bathroom, fabulous amenities, great balcony, wonderful restaurant, elegant common areas, meticulous and accommodating housekeeping staff, competitive room rate, knowledgeable concierge and bell staff.
UR69275634	The renovation of this hotel has produced some awesome rooms. I really like the bathrooms where the shower has this large plate stuck to the ceiling which produces something resembling a rainshower. I also like the separate entrance into the shower from the bathtub - that make sense even though no one else (to my knowledge) designs their bathrooms that way. The TV within the mirror is also a nice touch. The amenities are also first rate (L'Occitane). My only nit is that they don't give you a chocolate when they turn down your bed nor do they provide free wi fi service. Oh, by the way, they also attach your room key to a huge monster tassle with a brass cap. Now really - how convenient is it to put that huge thing in your pocket or purse? Overall though, this is an excellent hotel.
UR68717518	PROS The hotel was gloriously luxurious and immaculate throughout, all in splendid 19th Century style. Our room was enormous (we got a free upgrade to a Junior Suite) and extremely plush and comfortable. The bed was vast; there were two huge tvs (with lots of English channels) , separate hallway, two bathrooms, amazing rain shower & jacuzzi bath, etc. The staff were all very friendly, and the concierge so helpful with all sorts of questions we had about the city. None of that snootiness one can sometimes come across expensive hotels. The hotel was perfectly situated right in the centre of the City. CONS None I can think of! SUMMARY We felt truly well looked after, and hardly wanted to leave the hotel at all. This is 5-star living at its very best, and I'm sure this will soon be the number one hotel in Barcelona.
UR67344068	Excellent service from the start, where the consergiere took care of our luggage and requests efficiently. The first thing that striked us was the beautiful decoration of the hotel. Our room was very stylish and romantic. The comfort of the bathroom was excellent, and the cleaning of the room perfect. The breakfast was superb with numerous choices for every taste, and a beatiful setting in the garden. Thank you El Palace Hotel for making our honeymoon memorable!
UR66754947	I was traveling throughout spain w my parents and stayed at the palace for 5 days in early June. The hotel has gone under a recent facelift, and I think they did a great job. There is a perfect blend between modern touches and classic style. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. The bathroom alone is worth the stay. Best rain shower EVER! Location is great, only a few blocks from La Rambla. Concierge was also quite helpful in helping w dinner reservations. All his recommendations were good. Did not partake in the breakfast, but at 30+ Euros per person, I dont know who would! Free wired internet was a plus.
UR65478475	My daughter and I have an annual trip each year and the Palace Hotel certainly added to our experience this year. It is reminiscent of a lost age of luxury service and general beauty. The location is perfect for site seeing and shopping. The staff were extremely polite and helpful, and we enjoyed a great dinner there on our last night - perhaps a little expensive, but then so is Barcelona and for the surroundings and the service it was worth every Euro. The bar in the evening is a perfect antedote to the busy streets and sites of daytime, and the Gin and Tonics are a work of art! If ever I was returning to Barcelona I would return to the Palace/Ritz
UR65345998	The old Ritz Barcelona preserves the same atmosphere and magical elegance it had at the begining of the century, coupled with the amenities of modern life. It is not a hotel for business travelers, but it is a wonderful spot to be pampered and enjoy the luxury. Service from hotel personnel is superb with the personalized attention you'd expect from a hotel of this category.
UR63083700	Elegant and a truly nice hotel. Newly renovated, so very nice rooms. A former Ritz hotel, so the decor is ostentatious and 19th century .. BUT in a very good way. The hotel is placed right at the border between the "fancy" part of the Rambla and the old part of the city. So do be prepared to do some walking. The staff was polite and friendly.
UR61286879	Four days of sight seeing in Barcelona. This was the perfect hotel. From the prior reviews and pictures on the internet the hotel has obviously been redone. Our room was state of the art down to the motion sensor to turn on a night light if you got up at night. The restaurant was pricey 100 euro for salad, water and an entree, but all of Barcelona is pricey. Service was as grand as the hotel and the location is about as good as it gets. Center of town, many near by restaurants (try Moo, it is superb). The only problem is the hotel is built on the subway line and about every 2 minutes there is a very deep rumble that can be heard throughout the entire building (even on the sixth floor). We did not really find it a problem and is the only negative thing I can say about the hotel even thought it is a small problem.
UR61013041	I reviewed this hotel over 5 years ago, after checking in and checking out 10 minutes later. Approx 1 month ago I was contacted by Sr Joan Valls, the superb General Manager. He had read my negative review and invited me to a complimentary stay, following the Hotel's 30 million Euro refit....I was very impressed that he had made that much of an effort. I took him up on his offer and I was not disappointed. My room, a standard one, was far superior to many an executive room or junior suite that I have had in other hotels. The Plasma TV was cleverly concealed in an elegant Gilt edged mirror and the oversized bathroom had a superb sunken bath, in keeping with the style of the original hotel (The Palace started life as the Ritz, one of only 4 worldwide opened by Cesar Ritz). Breakfast was in a beautiful garden room and the choice of hot and cold buffet was excellent. Staff were both extremely friendly and professional, without being pretentious. The Hotel is in it's "soft opening" phase, so renovations are still being carried out. By year end there will be a new Spa (guests currently are offered use of a nearby health club at reduced rates) and there are plans to install a large indoor pool in the basement ballroom, along the lines of that of the Ritz, Paris (considered to be the largest and best indoor Hotel pool in the world). Once renovations are complete, I can honestly say that El Palace will undoubtedly become the Number 1 hotel in Barcelona. If I am forced to find fault, I would say that the beautiful breakfast room floor needs restoring/repolishing and the junior male waiters need to smarten up their uniforms. Larger, more substantial pillows are also needed on the beds. Apart from that, everything was perfect...give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Please also disregard any negative comments written before November 2009, when the Hotel reopened.
UR60936375	The hotel was close to the metro station and many of the major sites. It was in a very nice part of town, my daughter and I felt safe walking around the area. The hotel staff were friendly and gave good recommendations for dinner and places to see. We stayed there for the first couple nights of our trip, left to tour others parts of Spain and came back. The hotel was able to store a duffle bag for us until we returned. I was amazed how quiet the hotel was especially being in the middle of the city. The hotel also smelled really good and had really, really nice bathrooms.
UR59724261	We stayed at this elegant hotel six years ago and were pleased. The hotel has been refurbished with new furniture, new bathrooms, new carpets, and fresh paint. You can pamper yourself in the large beautiful rooms and comfortable beds. The staff is helpful and the location for walking is great.
UR59458579	My husband just returned from staying at the El Palace for 4 nights. The hotel is still in the "soft opening" stage; as a result of it, it is very quiet. During our stays, we rarely saw other guests. Staffs were very friendly. We got a newly renovated room on the top floor (6th floor). The room was very spacious. The bathroom has double vanity (horray!), separate bath and shower + the toilet was in a room by itself. The cons of the hotel: a) we were on the 6th floor and can still hear the subway/metro when it passes under the building. I can only imagine how much louder it would get if the room were on the lower floor b) it is within walking distance to all the major attractions. However, it is still a bit of a walk. During the day, it's totally fine walking everywhere. But at night time, after you have a large meal and drinks, it becomes a hike at 11pm/12am. We spent 2 nights at Hotel Neri which was right off La Rambla. It was def nice to be able to get home within 3 minutes after a night out. The pro, of course, would be that you get a very clam haven after a hectic day out in Barcelona. Overall, highly recommended if you don't mind walking....
UR55131878	Just stayed with my husband at the Palace and loved every minute of it. We were celebrating our anniversary. We loved staying in one of the new rooms of the Palace. Staff is friendly and helpfull, rooms are lovely, bathroom is super. The hotel is being renovated but we didn't hear a thing. The parts that are ready are very done in style. Prices are really nice during renovation.
UR48506838	As I have worked for a major U.S. airline for many years I have been lucky enough to stay in some of the worlds leading hotels. On our latest vacation to Barcelona, my husband and I had the good fortune to stay at the newly renovated Palace Hotel (formerly known as The Ritz.), We recommend this grand and elegant hotel to anyone who wants to experience old world charm, elegance and excellent service. The Palace Hotel is one of the best of the best and the staff goes out of their way to meet their customer's needs. We wil be back!
UR17461804	Faded grandeur, but we had a junior suite with two bathrooms that was very large and clean for a reasonable price, with a nice breakfast included. The hotel is very convenient for sight seeing.
UR13494567	We had a Junior Suite at the Palace Hotel, which was very beautiful and spacious. The bathrooms were made of orange marble. The service was outstanding. Their brakfast buffet is unequaled in quality and variety, and the maitre d' is the best! Our entire family was very pleased with the stay. I should add that the location is also very convenient. Fully recommend this hotel.
UR10657386	Great location just blocks away from Las Ramblas on the Gran Via de les Corts - a quick and direct taxi ride from the airport.. Old world style and class at this hotel, including great beds and linens in spacious rooms furnished with antiques. Soon to undergo renovation; one hopes the changes will be minimal. A great place to stay in a lovely city.
UR10046481	I just checked in today....and couldn't waste any time to post this review with the hope of saving someone else from a HUGE mistake in staying here! The staff is NOT professional, and are only trying to buy time for the next two weeks before they shut down for TWO YEARS! No one greeted us, no one had a smile. The carpet is totally all torn on the stairs...NO KIDDING...our room had pillows with blood stains...NO KIDDING...the seams in the carpet in the entry of the door to our room were all torn...NO KIDDING...there were dirty black finger prints all over the bathroom door handles form the inside...NO KIDDING...and the windows had face prints all over them from the previous guest...NO KIDDING...and no bars of soap in the bathroom at all...NO KIDDING. When I asked to talk to the manager...the response was "there is no manager" on weekends, only the housekeeping manager...and when I talked with him...he told me I am in THE best room...NO KIDDING! They tried to wash the wall, brought us two new pillows and some bars of soap...and not even a gentle apology or acknowledgement of the grosteque situation...NO KIDDING! Yes, we are talking about the same hotel...and I travel a lot...and am NOT a picky traveler. These are things you do not have to even think about for a 5+ hotel (and they are listed in the Luxury Hotels of the World as well). After a bit more discussion with the "manager" come to find out they are shutting down in 2 weeks...so the staff that is here is obviously the bare minimum. PLEASE...tell everyone you know so that they cancel their reservation!!!!! I even have photos I plan to post later...NO KIDDING!
UR10002454	Stayed for 3 nights for my wife's birthday. Great Location for shopping, the port and sightseeing. All the staff were very helpful and polite and focused on making our stay enjoyable. Excellent breakfast buffet with lots of choice. Main disappointment is the decor of the rooms, which truly does need the refurbishment that is promised in November. Bathroom also needed work and the shower was not what I expect from a good quality hotel. If you are prepared to put up with those shortcomings its a fine example of a 'Grand European Hotel'.
UR8446439	We've just come back after a few days at the Palace and loved it. Is some of the grandeur faded? Probably. They are about to start a refurbishment programme and my wife and I both hope that this doesn't detract from the magic of the place. Old fashioned room - but huge. Everything worked perfectly for us. The staff were very friendly and everyone speaks English. The hotel is about 5 mins from Las Ramblas and 20 mins from the Port Area. We loved it and would stay again tomorrow.
UR8427767	Coming back to our quiet room at the Palace after long days of sightseeing was a pleasure. The bed was very comfortable, and there were always plenty of big, thick towels in the bathroom, along with bathrobes. The staff was very helpful in booking tours and anything else we needed. English speaking staff members were always on duty. I will definitely stay there again.
UR8226010	I definitely would not stay in this hotel again. I think it probably was fabulous in its day - the rooms are large (we had adjoining ones), the lobby is lovely, and when it was a Ritz maybe it was great. But it is way past it's prime. The toilets wobbled, the elevators are slow, the smell of smoking was unacceptable even in non-smoking rooms, and it was very dusty. What they need is a major remodel. Definitely not a five star hotel no matter what the Spanish goverment says.
UR7544663	We have just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona. We were booked into the Husa Oriente but less than 24 hours before were informed that our hotel had technical problems and we had to be relocated. They had moved us to the Palace Hotel, formerly the Ritz. There were eight in our party, including 4 teenage children, split into 4 rooms. Although the change was a little worrying we were pleasantly surprised. The Palace is a very grand hotel, the rooms are enormous, 2 spacious bathrooms with seperate w.c. per bathroom, good showers, very good maid service. The reception staff were very helpful, arranging taxis, recommending restaurants, giving directions etc. The hotel has a lot of history (read the book in the room), in the middle of a busy old city, it is not a modern Las Vegas hotel so don't go there if that is what you are looking for in a hotel. Use the metro, easy to get to, cheap to use, don't use the turistic bus on a Sunday - too many queues. Highly recommended for a city break.
UR7382487	The public rooms of the hotel were superficially impressive, but the furniture was sad and in need of replacement. Likewise for our guest rooms, which were large and furnished with antiques, but were tired and in need of renovation in critical ways. The beds and pillows were second rate. The bathrooms were worse, including a plastic tub and smelly drains in the sinks. The concierges sent us to a tourist trap of a restaurant and were unhelpful in trying to arrange a tour of a site in the city.
UR7303040	I just returned as a solo traveler to Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel Palace in early April 2007. After much research, I was delighted with my choice and would stay at this property again. The service was amazing...all employees pleasant and eager to make your stay most comfortable. I decided on the breaksfast plan which was well worth the cost. A full and fresh breakfast offered in an elegant dining room. The room was beautiful! It was large and very comfortable. The maid service was excellent....very clean room and bathroom with service twice a day. After my arrival, a staff member arrived with a bottle of wine and chocolates. I felt very safe in this hotel. The lobby was wonderful and very inviting to sit and read and to enjoy social moments. It was centrally located to all the famous sights of Barcelona. I can honestly say, there was not one issue or slight complaint I had with this hotel. A perfect holiday in Barcelona at the Hotel Palace!!
UR7300448	We stayed at The Palace over Easter weekend 2007 and I would thorougly recommend it! The decor in the rooms is a bit beyond its best and shabby around the edges, but everything is provided and the rooms are enormous, with massive bathrooms. The reason I'd really recommend this hotel though is the service - the best I've ever had anywhere in the world. All the staff speak fluent English - even the chamber maids - and they were incredibly friendly, approachable and helpful. Our TV remote batteries died - there was someone at the door with fresh ones almost the second we'd hung up the phone to ask for them. My boyfriend wanted to know the score in a football game happening in England - the concierge checked on the internet for him right away. We wanted a restaurant recommendation - the concierge not only made several recommendations, but left a note in our pigeon-hole with their addresses and directions. In every situation, they did their absolute utmost to help us, and always graciously and with good humour. We would definitely stay again, so what if the carpets are a bit faded?
UR6748282	We're just back from a short break from 1/2 - 3/2. We choose this hotel based from its 5 star rating and its location which is very near to Plaza Catalunya. Although there are other 5 star hotels which is in that area ie Le Meridian & Hotel Majestic - we didn't like both the hotel's room deco (based from hotel pics) and it is slightly more expensive that this Palace Hotel and so we decided to book this hotel. We got a good rate from the hotel's website [-] at the rate of euro190 & euro170 for 2 nite Compared with both hotels (we did check out both of them) we love Palace Hotel much better. The deco of the hotel's lobby & restaurant are so exquisite. Here's the details:- ROOM The room is really huge for a standard room - about 38m2. Which far bigger than the other 5 star hotels. As soon as you enter, there are a hallway that leads to the bathroom on the right and the bedroom straight ahead. Very comfortable King bed with 2 comfortable wide pillows and 2 square pillows. 2 sofa and a coffee table in front of the main windows. Flat tv and a walking closet!! we certainly didn't expect that at all - although the deco is a bit simple, it should have more of flowers and some more furniture since the room is huge. The furniture in the bedroom are sheer exquisite antiques, which you rarely find in other modern hotels these days. However, lack of sound proof actually lets us down - we can actually hear footsteps from the room upstairs. Luckily, they (guest on the room upstairs) check outs after the 1st nite so we were lucky. I think because of the age of the buiding (which is built in 1919) they needs to improve the sound proofing and the reception did explain to us that they are planning to do the renovation to improve the problem - starting nxt July 07. Yes, the carpeting and the bathroom is a bit outdated but it did nothing to prevent us from having a good time. Contrast from previous review -- we did not have any problem with the shower. It was overall good. LOCATION The hotel is sitiuated in the corner lot, in front of the main road Gran Via which can be bit noisy with lack of sound proof Main attractions - Plaza Catalunya and La Ramblas is just 10 minutes walk , about 2 blocks away. We always had a nice walk from and to the hotel, as the area is very well cared for with lots of shops. It was great to stay away from the hotel in La ramblas area as it can be quite busy sometime and more area to walk and explore. Take the Touristic bus which has stop at the Plaza catalunya - it is essential in Barcelona as the city is really huge. Passage De Gracia - main street for shopping is just 10 mins walk STAFF & SERVICE I would give 10/10 to the service given by their staff. They are absolutely fantastic. When we arrived at the hotel, the bell boy - Louis showed us tour of the hotel - the restaurants and everything you need to know about the guest room BREAKFAST I would say the Diana restaurant which is the breakfast room is an absolute stunner - it felt like having a breakfast in a park! The rate didn't include breakfast but we decided to check out the breakfast - it was a bit pricey at 21 euro per person but worth it. There are lots of choices to choose from - 2 types 0f spanish omelletes, scrambled eggs, baked beans, sausages, choices of breads, fruits, cereals and even a special breakfast area especially for diabetic Although we had a great time but I think we would't stay again at this hotel, just simply because lack of the sound proof but we might check it out after they had finished their renovation.
UR6534598	My wife and I travelled to Barcelona to stay at the Ritz at the end of November. The good: It is a beautiful old hotel with an incredible location. The doorman and the bellhops were very helpful and friendly. The rooms have a lot of great character that one would expect from a grand old hotel. The bad: While the doorman and bellhops were friendly, the front desk was not as hospitable. They were unfriendly and rude during check in. And at check out, after having spend 5 nights, they insisted that someone made a call from our room and we would have to pay for it. We proved to the mean lady at the front that we were at the Palau Nacional (beautiful venue) at the time of the call and clearly one of the maids/hotel workers had made the call from our room during turn-down service. After having spend 5 nights, she was insistent on the 3 euro charge and was very rude. One experience like this can lend a bad taste to an entire vacation. With so many other great hotels in Barcelona, I will never stay at this hotel again nor recommend it to any of my friends. I hope the 3 euros was worth it to the hotel.
UR6481077	Booked through special offer on Travelzoo. Went for a room rather than taking free upgrade to a suite as was told that these had no windows and we like a view. Fabulous frontage, reception, lounge etc with groovy chandeliers and all very nicely decorated for Christmas. Huge, high room, about the floor space of our entire downstairs, massive comfy bed and large bathroom with freebie toiletries, slippers & nice thick towelling robes. Staff and concierge all very helpful and friendly. Chose to have a lie-in rather than breakfast which was £15 pp, better to go a cafe locally if on a budget. Only tiny problems - had to remind about our welcome cava & chocs which then arrived promptly and a little noise from the road and Metro but we live in the country so prob most people wouldn't even notice. The flatscreen telly looked so incongruous in what was once the Ritz! Overall very pleasant and comfortable stay, excellent position for walking to Ramblas, old town in one direction or La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia etc in the other. Loads of bars & restaurants every where.
UR6335777	Very nice old hotel. Beautiful lobby. But the shower was a disaster, if you can call it a shower. it was basically a showerhead with a drain to catch the water, no walls, so you freeze as you're taking a shower....until the water starts to flip out on you, first it scalds you, then it freezes you, then it goes back to giving you 3rd degree burns on 80% of your body.
UR6020601	stayed there in october. The location is good, because an underground-garage is near, you can reach it easily and it´s only a ten minutes walk to the very heart of the town, and five minutes to the area where you find many nice shops and several buildings of gaudi. The building is a typical turn of the century hotel in a style you would await in a palace. the ground floor rooms are magnificent in a vaguely french style as in all ritz hotels and well maintained. Our room was although only an ordinary one big with a comfortable bed, the usual fittings including a marble mantlepiece. The bathroom was tiled with pink marble. i´ve seen this before in josephine baker´s house and that comes to me when i say ritzy. unfortunately a cheap restauration took place and parts of the former golden-coloured plumbing were replaced by chrome, but only parts. as i am no decorator, i could use it as well. room service was fast, efficient and friendly. isolation from the noise outside is very efficient. we would stay there again.
UR5935038	I too was worried that I had made an incorrect choice after reading some of the reviews but after contacting the hotel beforehand they assured me that although the renovations would not start until 2007 we would be allocated a very nice room. The building itself is so impressive - in particular the Hall Bar/Lounge and the entrance. We had booked the standard deluxe room and it was spotlessly clean, full of antique furniture, a huge huge bed (very very comfortable), robes, slippers etc. The blackout linings at the window were excellent and we heard very little noise - it certainly did not disturb our sleep. Breakfast was excellent - every choice you could think of and omelettes and eggs made to order. The Hall Bar service was excellent. I would certainly return - because of the wonderfully central location and the facilities offered. The room service was the quickest room service I have experienced. Try "Little Italy" restaurant on the street opposite on the other side of the Gran Via (live jazz with excellent food). If you like traditional decor and furnishings you can't beat it - if you prefer modern 'cold' hotels don't stay here.
UR5881231	After reading several disappointing reviews, we were concerned about the reservation we had made for this property. We contacted the hotel directly and were informed that renovation would be starting the month after we would be here. I saw on Trip Advisor that some of the rooms had been renovated, but not all of them. We were assured that we would be well taken care of and decided to stick with our reservation. Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were informed that we had been upgraded to a mini suite and it was beautiful and spacious. The bed was larger than king size and was entered through double doors off the living room. There was a walk-in closet with separate hanging areas for my husband and myself - all paneled in a beautiful cognac colored wood stain. The bathroom was extremely large with double sinks - a separate glassed in area for the toilet and bidet, and then a large tub and separate shower at the end of the room. The shower had several different spray heads aimed at various areas of one's anatomy which was great. We thought the staff was cordial, courteous and personable. Our only regret was the fact that they were having a wedding reception the night of our arrival and so the main public room was closed off to the hotel guests - but was open the next morning. We believe it's always a good idea to communicate with your hotels before arrival and have had excellent service and attention when we have done this. We did hear from other guests that their rooms were not renovated yet, but were large and spacious. I would add that my husband and I both had massages while we were there and they were two of the best we've ever had! The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and we were delighted with the choices as well as the service. The setting was elegant and beautiful. We will definitely return to this property for not only it's excellent location, but also for the attention and service we received as guests.
UR5620366	3 blocks from Las Ramblas Older building Large, comfortable rooms Consierge
UR4952691	We stayed here for a week in '04, and the reviews on TripAdvisor since then did give us pause for concern in booking again for Feb. '06. We visit Europe 4-5 times a year, and always stay in 4-or 5-star hotels, many of them also affiliated with LHW. I E-mailed them in November with my concerns about the renovation and the complaints registered here. I received a prompt E-Mail back, stating that the renovation would not start until later in '06 and we would be assured of a room in fine condition. We paid 190 Euros/nt for the identical room we had on the sixth floor two years ago. It was great; good bedding, high-quality linens, bathrobes and slippers, nice toiletries, a gift of chocolates and Spanish wine in the room. Everything was exceptionally clean. Yes, there were some "dings" on the chair by the desk, and a couple of very minor spots on the carpeting. Planning to write a review here upon our return, I specifically looked for the issues that were noted in previous reviews. But for the most part, there is very little to criticize. The service remains exemplary. The doorman, David (from Pennsylvania) is a gem... very helpful with directions, recommendations, and a taxi when we needed one. Both he and the concierege staff remembered us and gave us a warm welcome. The concierge staff are great... they provided wonderful restaurant recommendations. The location, for us, is ideal... several great tapas places within a few blocks, 4 blocks from Plaza Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas. With the windows closed, no street noise to be heard at all. The only thing you have to be careful about is that the taxi drivers still know the hotel as "the Ritz", not "the Palace". There are several hotels in BCN with "palace" as part of the name, and we were taken to several of them by mistake. You have to give the driver the name AND street address.... get the hotel's card when you arrive, and provide it to any taxi driver you use. Is it the Four Seasons in Istanbul, the Grand Bretagne in Athens, or the Grand Hotel in Stockholm? No, it is showing a bit of wear. It needs some TLC to restore its former luster. But it is still a very well-managed, charming, old-world hotel in a great location in Barcelona.
UR4721051	We stayed at the hotel in May pre-cruise, two rooms, one for my wife and son and I, one for my inlaws. My inlaws had a standard room, we had a junior suite. It was a wonderful experience. I will agree that there are some items that will benefit from the curent upgrading--such as the air conditioning system--but it is a beautiful and classic hotel. Our junior suite had two large and perfectly maintained bathrooms and curtains to separate the sleeping and sitting area. When I asked for sheets for the fold out sofa where our son was to sleep, a team from housekeeping arrived and brought a complete mattress to put on top of the pull out mattress so our son would be more comfortable--amazing service. My inlaws were delighted with their room as well. The public areas are spectacular, and the breakfast room is one of the best I have ever seen. This hotel is a jewel, and it just needs a litte shine to return to former glory
UR4627401	You can see how this was once "the hotel" in Barcelona (when it was The Ritz), and there is still a lot to love here, but it's not all it could be, anymore. The public spaces are grand, and a lot of the furnishings and fixtures were beautiful antiques, incl. in the room. Some, however, were too well worn, others not so clean looking (too many fingerprints on elevator doors, windows and headboards) - although the most important items like linens and baths were pristine. Some updating and attention to details (install modern locks and safes, brighten the room decor, bring back the robes, etc.)would go a long way. Since we spent 5 days here, we appreciatated the spaciousness of the rooms, the high ceilings, large double vanities,twin closets and comfy king bed. We had a great view over Barcelona to Mt Tibidabo and La Sagrada Familia from our small terrace on the top floor, and service was efficient and unobtrusive. We actually chose this hotel for its compromise location, on the lower edge of the upscale Eixample area, and while only a few blocks from the center of it all, Plaza de Catalunya, it was far enough from La Rambla's crowds to be quiet and relaxing. However, we found that the Barri Gotic/Born/Old City areas (away from touristy La Rambla)were more enjoyable and unique to Barcelona - and wished we had chosen to stay somewhere there, instead.
UR4441156	For the price, it was not worth the money. The location is reasonable, but I could not get a good night sleep because the mattress was old and soft. My husband and I would end up sinking towards the middle of the bed while we slept. When I complained to the hotel they simply shrugged their shoulders and didn't do anything about it.
UR128399529	The hotel is in a great location and we found the staff to be very welcoming and friendly. If you do decide to stay here, it is definitely worth upgrading your room to one with a view of the cathedral. The view is absolutely wonderful. The rooms are very comfortable but we did think the breakfast could offer a better selection and the quality of the breads was disappointing. If we come back to Barcelona, we would stay here again but would just book room only rather than B&B. Overall, would definitely recommend the hotel. Great location in a fantastic city.
UR128306347	Booked a meduim priced room and requested a balcony and high floor, both of which we got. Room was large and light and airy, but the view was magnificent. Right across from the Gothic Cathedral. Room was not luxurious but quite nice, comfortable,with two chairs which we pulled in front of window to view the cathedral. Couldn't ask for a better location. Staff were helpful. Skipped breakfast (too expensive) but there are places around to pick up something. Would definitely recommend.
UR128235914	Hotel Colon is literally in the heart of the old city, in a pedestrian area, on the square just opposite the Cathedral of Saint Eulalia. The area is safe and clean full of street entairtainers. Our room was on the back side overlooking a back yard. It was clean and well maintained, really spacious with an equally spoasious ensuite bathroom which had a bathtub and a separate shower.The turn down service and the chocolate was a nice touch, albeit we would appreciate tea-coffee making facilities. Our friends had a Cathedral view room which was quite small even by European standards. The front desk personel is OK, albeit to my opinion a bit indifferent. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel because we thought was quite expensive considering that the area around the square is full of nice cafes and eateries. We also visited the near-by Saint Caterina's Market, a lively palce frequented by locals, where we had enjoyed our breakfast (fresh fruit juice, coffee, sandwiches, croissant etc) at a very reasonable price. One evening we had lunch at the hotel Restaurant. To my opinion waste of money. The atmosphere is quite OK but the food was nothing special and the prices high especially for a city like Barcelona which is full of all kind of restaurants.
UR128120646	Second leg of our Europe trip. Arrived here from Paris and was blown away by our room 604 with enormous terrace overlooking the cathedral. Staff excellent,breakfast very good with espresso machine and fesh squeezed orange juice. The location couldn't be better and was very impressed with the whole experience.
UR127951914	This hotel is situated as comfortably close to absolutely everything as possible in the wonderful city of Barcelona. It is a old and somewhat shabby family hotel, but with a lot of grace and old-world charm. The rooms are comfy, clean and the beds passable, the breakfast a pleasant surprise with all that the heart desires. Even freshly pressed orange juice. The staff is somewhat uptight - I would not say that the wish to please is sitting in the driver's seat - rather - you have to follow the rules of the house. We were reprimanded in a very brusque way when we put our (stockinged) feet up sitting in the sofa of the day room in the reception, and they laughed in our faces when we asked if we could borrow a small chair from the corridor as we had one too little in the room. We were rather taken aback. I think the staff is so used to the guests beeing charmed by the old place and that they are so in-bred that they sorely need a brush-up on how to treat guests. A typical example of hybris, I am sorry to say. But - don't let that stop you from staying there - you'll live well with the drawbacks. Just notice that the hotel does not have wi-fi. They say they do but they don't.
UR127690972	The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect, close to the sites, good cafes and shopping. I was only in Barcelona for 2 days and this was a good home base to see the highlights. As a single female traveler, I felt very safe in this hotel (the front desk staff were very attentive to who was coming and going and I even saw them ask some gentlemen to leave when they came in to use the lobby washroom and the staff inquired if they were staying in the hotel.) The single rooms are a good size and even though mine did not have a view of the Cathedral, it was still a pleasant place to stay.
UR127586757	Stayed for 4 nights at the stat of April. Have to say the Hotel ticked all the boxes for us. Room was small but well laid out, clean and quite. We were on the 5th floor facing onto the side street. Had good view of the Square from our small balcony. Overall the Hotel looked very well and we did not get any sense of it being worn or outdated, as has been mentioned in other reviews. Staff were extremely polite and courteous both in the Hotel and at the outside terrace bar. Again, the most important attribute of the Hotel is it's location. You are pretty much a short walk to the marina, Las Ramblas and more importantly, you are on the doorstep of the Gothic area with it's warren of streets which have so much to explore. We spent a whole day just wandering around, visiting the Cathedral (Beautful interior) and the other Churches and museums in the area. Visit the Placa Reial and the Boqueria Market. Take a Bus Tour to see the outlying sites, cable car to montjuic. Take the Blue Tram up to the Venicular to Tibidabo (Have lunch here overlooking the city). Basically just enjoy this great city. Overall, loved the hotel and would have to say I could not see any of the issues that had been highlighted in other reviews. will certainly stay here again when we return.
UR127469704	Hotol Colon can't be beat for its location. The hotel sits right on the corner of the central plaza with Barcelona's cathedral. It is also nestled in the quaint alleys of the Gothic quarter and minutes from the bustle of the Rambla. For location it gets 5 stars. But, the hotel is listed as a 4 star property, and I can't agree with that overall. The room I got on the backside of the hotel was very reasonably priced at 99 euro a night, but very out of date and tired looking. The furnishings scream 1980, the bed was wafer thin, and it was difficult to judge how clean the room was (despite the piercing smell of lemon scented cleaner). The bath had plenty of hot water, a definite plus, but was a bit dingy and the toilet leaked slightly around the base. Bring your own toiletries because the shampoo and soap from the hotel are over scented, scouring, and somewhat cheap.
UR127454939	Stayed here for 3 days - had booked room with terrace overlooking the cathedral on the advice of TA reviews and was not disappointed. Room was quite small, but well equipped and fairly luxurious - and the terrace area was just perfect. When we were in the room we spent most of our time on the terrace watching the various goings on down below in the the area in front of the cathedral. On Saturday night there was a band and local people were dancing - on Sunday morning there was also quite a lot of activity but as we were going out we did not see what it was. Have read other reviews I can agree that the food was expensive and ordinary - breakfast definitely was not worth it, but don't let that stop you staying here as in every other way the hotel was perfect for a stay in Barcelona.
UR126956335	Spent five nights at the hotel in early March. Paid extra for a room with a cathedral view which made the break extra special as the view of the cathedral and Avenida de la Catedral - a pedestrianised street - was stunning. Our room was on the 5th floor so we had a clear view of the cathedral. 2nd floor rooms might be obscured by trees. Small balcony so we could open the doors and hear the guitar, violin etc playing from the square which made us feel part of the crowd. Soundproofing was very good so most noise was blocked out (except for the diggers at the Cathedral but these stopped by about 5 p.m.) when we shut the doors. It was quiet late in the evening anyway so not a problem. Nice cafe outside to sit and watch the people go by. The room was very clean and with a turndown service if you wanted it. Decor was okay but a bit bland. Lots of storage space. Reception staff were very helpful and gave me directions to the beer festival. Location was excellent, we could walk everywhere we wanted. If not the HoHo bus stopped about 200 yards away on the main road. We would definately stay here again.
UR126843494	A wonderful hotel facing the Cathedral - do go for the upgrade to a Cathedral facing room. Comfortable and well appointed rooms with a view of daily life in Barcelona. Children going to school to the Barcelona marathon - all past your balcony in the sun. Watching the Sardana on Saturday night and Sunday afternoon was magical and the buskers play some very high quality music. A gentle stroll to the Ramblas, to Ribero, the Port, Plaza Catalunya- an ideal base for exploring this wonderful city. The hotel staff were excellent. The breakfasts very good which really set you up for the day.
UR126586142	The Hotel Colon is located right across the plaza from the catherdral. Besides being centrally located and conveninent to everything, the plaza location provides a bit of calm and open space in the heart of a busy city. Outdoor tables provide a pleasant place to watch the world go by. We splurged and got a room with a terrace, which was surprisingly large, complete with table and chairs and a view of the cathedral. The cathedral is under renovation, and occasionally we were bothered by construction noises, but all work stopped by 5 pm, and the nights were very quiet. The only down side, and it is not insignificant, is internet service. While allegedly the hotel has wifi, it was not functioning at all during the 4 nights we were there. The hotel does not have a business center, or any publicly available computers. Their suggestion was to go to the hotel around the corner, sit in their lobby and use their wifi service. The other hotel staff were gracious about our camping in their lobby, but it is far from an ideal situation. When I asked whether we would get a discount for the lack of internest service, it was explained to me that the wifi service is free, so the fact that it isn't working doesn't merit a refund. I tried to explain that had I known the hotel had NO internet survice I wouldn't have chosen to stay there, but did that did not change things.
UR126432272	We booked two double rooms for a 3 night stay in Barcelona March 2012. The hotel is wonderfully placed right in front of the old Gothic Cathedral with a lovely square in front of it with events, live music and entertainers. You can pay a little more for a cathedral view room but we were very happy with our side view and our balcony in the sun. The double glazing is very good and we weren’t disturbed at all. Staff were helpful and attentive at all times and we loved the delivery of two chocolates in the evening. Comfy beds and clean bathrooms with a good supply of complimentary toiletries (shower gel, shampoo, moisturiser, soap etc.). Bring your own conditioner. We didn’t eat in the hotel so I cannot comment about that – there are plenty of lovely places nearby. Sadly the WIFI in the hotel didn’t work during our stay, so if that is important to you it might be worth checking directly before you leave home. Jaume 1 is the nearest Metro station and about 10 mins walk. Liceu is on the Ramblas and about 10 mins walk in the opposite direction. If you are just staying a few days and will be using the underground I highly recommend the T10 Transport Ticket. Which costs €9.25 (£7.72) and will save you the trouble of buying individual tickets for each journey. A normal single journey ticket costs you €2.00 so with a T10 you save €10.75 for 10 journeys! More info here: www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/transport/barcelona-metro.html The underground is excellent, clean, spacious and easy to use. Tickets need to be inserted into the entry barriers and then can be put away as you don’t need them to exit the underground. We enjoyed a visit to the zoo which is surprisingly large with an excellent dolphin show. The beach is nearby (walking distance 10 mins) with lots of bars and restaurants. If you visit before the end of March check out: www.zoobarcelona.cat/en As you can get a 50% reduction in the price. The Sagrada Familia (modern Gaudi designed cathedral is a must but avoid weekends as queues can be long). E13 basic ticket or more to take the lift up the tower. Don’t miss the exhibition where you can get an idea of what it will look like when finished. (2030?) For a further dose of Gaudi … try Park Guell at the back of the city with wonderful views out to the sea. La Pedera (Casa Milla) and Casa Battlo are also fascinating. As there was four of us we took a taxi from the airport costing us just under E30 (about £25) and took about half an hour. Be careful if you ask the hotel to call you one for the return journey as there seemed to be another E10 added to that. BEWARE – and I’m sure you’ve read it 100 times OF PICK POCKETS. Don’t let it worry you as I felt 100% safe at all times but don’t let your holiday be spoilt. We were so careful, and still found a well dressed, well groomed young lady with her hand in our rucksack whilst having breakfast in a small café. Fortunately there was nothing there she wanted. Have your handbag on your lap and tuck your rucksack between your feet. Having said all that …. I LOVED BARCELONA, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AND WILL RETURN.
UR124922057	This time we were in the Gothic Quarter. The Colon is chic, full of tradition and very well located. We chose a beautiful suite with a splendid terrace overlooking the Barcelona Cathedral. We dined every night at the hotel restaurant, which has chairs on the sidewalk. Nothing like ending the night drinking champagne on the terrace of our room. Everything was perfect.
UR124877326	The rooms are a bit old but you have everything you need, bathroom is very well equiped! Good service,clean and the breakfast is superb!!! The location is perfect to visit the old city part, very good choice and will probably stay here again when ever going back to Barcelona.
UR124354960	It seems everyone is in agreement with the location... perfect, especially for someone who has no sense of direction: just find the Cathedral and you're there (the Cathedral is amazing). The Aerobus from the airport was a snap, and it dropped us off at Plaza Catalunya, only a short walk from the hotel. Tough to beat the narrow streets and alleys of the Gothic Quarter. Hotel staff were charming and helpful. We stayed in a room with a balcony that faced the Cathedral...a little bit of magic. I'll definitely stay here again if I find myself in Barcelona.
UR124163037	Hotel Colon in Barcelona is right in front of the Cathedral in the Gothic neighborhood, it is a perfect location if visiting the city. A 5 to 10 minutes walk to Plaza Catalunya where you can take the Aerobus (6 euros, about 25 minutes, leaves every 5 to 10 minutes) to/from the airport. The hotel is friendly and well kept, everything in the room worked fine and the size was quite good for european standards. Just one suggestion: bring an electric extension cord as there was only one electric plug near the TV a couple of meters far from the desk. Excellent price quality choice.
UR124074251	My husband and I have just returned from a long weekend staying at this Hotel. We had a fantastic break which was topped off by this great hotel. The location was fantastic, the staff very helpful & friendly. Our room was lovely and spacious, ok we didn't have a great view but who spends there break in the room with a fantastic place like Barcelona to explore. The restaurant meal we had was great, food was delicious and well presented with attentive staff. Breakfast was buffet style and covered every taste. I would recommend this hotel to any visitor.
UR124068078	I stayed at Hotel Colon for four nights, visiting friends in Barcelona and found the hotel accommodating, friendly, filled by international co-travellers and a competent staff. Being a lady travelling by myself I felt quite safe. Of course the location is excellent, but also the room, the public spaces, the breakfast area, the bar were cosy and elegant. Breakfast was copious and could be taken until eleven! Staff were friendly and competent - very nice reception staff!- and hygienic standards absolute top. The room was quiet (at the back of the hotel) and nicely decorated. I would definitely choose this hotel again on my next trip and certainly reccommend it to friends!
UR123504641	I stayed here for 8 days last summer, and enjoyed it a lot! The best location ever - in front of the Cathedral, steps away from the Gothic District, and minutes away from the La Rambla. It's a very touristic area but not too noisy. Ask for the Cathedral view rooms, they will give you a great, beautiful view and a bigger room. The hotel restaurant has seatings inside or outside, so you can enjoy the view and do some people watching :) There are also lots of restaurants around the hotel, all pretty touristic though. The rooms are not too small, ok size. They are huuuge comparing to Parisian hotels. The furniture is pretty old, and the walls can be dirty in some places, but the hotel still very charming :) The service was always very good, everyone was extremely helpful, trying to help to get around the city. Generally, people in Barcelona are very friendly and helpful around the city. Many times they'd take extra time to explain me how to get to a certain location or recommend you a good spot. And if you ask for a good restaurant or a lounge is, oh boy! They'll invite you to the restaurants with them, and you'll have the best time ever! :))) But back to the Colon hotel. The breakfast offers pretty standard options but a LOT of them :) No need to diet when you're in Barcelona :))) In summer time you can walk down the La Rambla towards the Colon monuments, and get to the bay area. If you take left and walk a little bit, you'll get to the city beach - Barceloneta beaches (or you can take train - yellow line L4 to Barceloneta. Taxi from the hotel to the beach will be about 7 euro). They are very crowded usually, if you keep walking to the left side, you'll get to the better beaches - Icaria and Mar Bella (nudist beach). It's about the same 5-7 minutes walk from the Colon hotel to the La Rambla (one way) or Placa de Catalunya. Both are very touristic areas, very interesting, with lots of little stores, bars, restaurants, BUT be aware of the street thieves! The main shopping area is Passeig de Gracia is about 15 minutes walking distance from the Colon hotel. On this street you can see two of the most beautiful Gaudi's creations - La Pedrera and Casa Batlló. To get to the Sagrada Familia you should take a bus. And there is a bus stop of the Hop On/Hop Off tour just next to the Colon Hotel. I would highly recommend ti take the tours, it's very helpful and informative. There is also a bank with ATM, a pharmacy, and a parking next to the hotel door. In conclusion, the Colon hotel is one of the best options to stay while you're in Barcelona, I'm going back for sure!
UR123445947	This hotel was in the heart of everything in Barcelona. I really enjoyed it, they also had good security and made sure to be helpful with anything you needed.
UR123245971	This hotel has a very central location and faces the hustle and bustle of the Catedral area in Barcelona. However the hotel itself is extremely peaceful and quiet. The lobby, the restaurant and the public rooms have a nice cozy old-world feeling, which makes it pleasant to return after a day of sight-seeing. Our room had a balcony and the rate, breakfast (very good) included, was certainly reasonable. The staff is friendly and helpful.
UR123030903	The Hotel Colon is on the square across from the Barcelona Cathedral. It's right in the heart of the gothic district with restaurants, shopping and history. The Cathedral is beautiful. Hotel Colon is an older Hotel but well preserved and classy. Try to get a balcony room overlooking the square and watch the people gather and dance on the weekends. In fact GO JOIN THEM! Sunday Brunch was delicious and reasonable at $18 euros considering what you might get in a restaurant outside for $10-15.
UR122762604	We stayed for 3 nights at the Hotel Colon early December, 2011, during the Christmas markets. Our room for 2 cost 120 euros per night, without breakfast. What a location! Not only was the Christmas Market right outside our hotel, but we walked easily to lots of shopping and to many of the top sights around Barcelona. We got the correct room we booked, It was average sized, with doors that led to a very small balcony where we were able to see the activity of the market. The beds were comfortable. The staff was very helpful, one of the few hotels we stayed at where the staff was eager to carry our bags to our room. The hotel is older, but very clean and comfortable with updated bathrooms. We did not opt for the breakfast, so can't help you there. We did find a cafe about a 5 minute walk from the hotel that had good American breakfasts: eggs, omelets..... It was Cafe Gloria, kind of behind the cathedral off of Via Laietana, on Carrer de la Tapineria. There are some tables outside. It is a small, no frills, inexpensive place that serves Illy coffee and good breakfasts in general. Fast, friendly service. Excellent hotel for the price.
UR122709091	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights precruise from 23rd Dec. and everything about our stay was first class. It is an older style hotel but excellent. The staff were friendly and helpful, even warning about the pickpockets. We had breakfast included in our deal and have to say that it could not be faulted on the choices available or the quality. If I had to visit Barcelona again I would definitely use this hotel.
UR122067803	We did a two day trip to Barcelona from Paris nd stayed at the Hotel Colon what a treat, It was expensive but right in the city center and great staff and a great room. We splurged for our two day stay. I highly reccomend this hotel.
UR122064957	We arrived in Barcelona without any hotel reservations due to time constraint, and we really regret it. We searched by foot and taxi for 4 hours to get an available room but the cheapest one was Hotel Colon at 260Euros per night (July 2011)! And so we checked-in. The hotel is actually very nice, but it's quite old.. It should have been a more pleasant stay if they didn't provide us with two single beds joined together--with that rate, at least i deserve to get a queen-sized bed. I love the restaurants around it, and the accessibility of public transpo. I just hope that the rates are cheaper, but I'm a satisfied cust anyway :)
UR121498917	My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon in November 2011. They gave us an upgrade to a suite. We loved the location, the room was clean, and the staff was very friendly. We added the breakfast to the package, but only went to breakfast one day. It was ok, but I'd advise to just save the money and go to a local bakery for some breakfast. We had a partial review of the Cathedral which was beautiful. But our main view was of an office, which really didn't bother us. Just don't use the bathroom and have the balcony door open at the same time! ;-) We really enjoyed our stay at Colon Hotel, we spoke highly of it to everyone who asked! Thanks for making our stay enjoyable!
UR121352547	We stayed at the Hotel Colon for 4 nights in late August. We had just gotten off our cruise ship and wanted to really explore the fascinating city of Barcelona. The Hotel Colon is an older hotel, but still stately and impressive. The location is fantastic. You are in a pedestrian square right opposit the Cathedral. There is always something happening in the square - protests, street performers, or just the crowds walking by. You are right in the middle of where you want to be. Walking the narrow streets of the Barrio Gotico is amazing! Easy to get to Las Rambla (but too noisy to stay in a hotel there) Our room was on the 4th floor with a small balony looking out towards the Cathedral. Light and airy room. Beautiful bathroom. We were with another couple and they did not fare as well as we did - they were on the 1st floor with a smaller room, no balcony, darker room. We paid the same price for our rooms. Because of the location you can never get lost...always signs pointing to the catherdal Only one negative thing. Our first night the 4 of us asked the manager for a restaurant recommendation. Big mistake! He steered us to an expensive place which was not what we wanted. We had explained our parameters to him but his suggestion was totally overpriced.. He did help us later in our trip for information getting to some of the sites we wished to see. Barcelona is really a great city. Definitely go see much of the Gaudi sights. Each one is more amazing than the next. We took the hop on/hop off bus to get a good feel for the city. Most important tip I can give you is get out there and walk. That is always the best thing to do in cities. We walked to Barceloneta, the beaches, the old olympic village. Visit La Boqueria, the open food market on La Rambla. You really get to see the city this way. Wonderful vacation. I would recommend this hotel for its location.
UR121016723	Before going to Barcelona I have studied many hotels, and according to my criterias I have chosen Hotel Colon, and It was really a perfect choice! Just in front of the Cathedral, outside the hotel's main door, the right side is the Gothic Quarter. Walk on the narrow streets around cathedral, and find the route that takes you to the seaside, do not worry about to be lost, these narrow streets are worth to discover. The Famous La Ramblas is just 3-5 mins far away from the hotel, and the street portal de'l Angel is between the La Ramblas and the hotel. Placa Catalunya is also very close to the hotel. Our room was the Junior Suite which has two connected rooms with two small balconies faced to the Cathedral and the view was really perfect. Hotel is really clean and has helpful stuff. Next time, stay again. And people who wants taste delicious tapas should try tapas bar Bilbao-Berria in the Cathedral square on the right of the hotel.
UR121006185	I stayed at the Colon Hotel, Barcelona for 2 nights and it was a great choice because of the location. It is right in the heart of the Barrio Gotica (the old quarters), directly opposite the Cathedral. Because the Cathedral is located in a plaza, there is no traffic directly outside the hotel, which is always a plus point in my book! But the plaza was alive with people visiting the Cathedral and the weekend I was there, the plaza was host to a Food & Wine Fair - so there was lots to gaze at! I stayed in a Superior Double Room with Terrace on the top floor. I had no idea what the room was going to be like, as on their website for this room, they only show the terrace but I had a look at the other rooms on the site and they all seemed well appointed and had a feeling of space. However, the room itself was a little disappointing and was very small. Where the other rooms on the website had sofas etc in the rooms, this one didn't, but it didn't need it to have as has the most amazing terrace! It was huge and decorated with orange, lemon and olive trees and has an electric sunshade for both sun protection and shelter and the view across the city at dusk / night time when all the buildings put their lights on was superb. I have to say that I am 100% delighted that I chose this room, as the terrace made the whole space an enjoyable stay. As far as the room goes though, it was clean and functional and the reception staff all speak a multitude of languages and were very helpful with my check in and out. Being a slightly older hotel, it is presented well with marble floors and lots of wood and being located in the heart of the Barrio Gotico there are so many cafes, restaurants and bars to choose from that I didn't eat in the hotel, so cannot comment about the food. And the Barrio Gotico itself offers so much, especially in the early evening, when the small shops reopen after siesta and the narrow paved streets around the Cathedral are filled with delicious smells, older couples taking an evening stroll and very, very good musicians busking in the streets. If you are looking for a hotel in a great location, that has that non-pretentious feel, reasonably priced for what you get but yet in the heart of the city, is tranquil and clean and comfortable then look no further!
UR120431490	The Hotel Colon was a perfect hotel for my wife and me while in Barcelona for our cruise. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a corner suite, with separate living room, bathroom and bedroom. It overlooked the cathedral and plaza, so it was absolutely perfect! The bellmen were very nice (one was from the US) and accomodating, providing directions and recommendations as requested. The breakfast, which was included, was very good, and ample. Many selections were available and for the most part, it was very good. We felt very safe in that area of the city as there were always a number of people in the plaza. It was also just a short 20 minute cab ride to the port to board our ship. I would highly recommend the Colon Hotel and if we ever return to Barcelona, we will most definately stay there again.
UR120355644	This hotel is very central for most places and only a short ride to the cruise ship terminal . We have stayed here more than once and intend to return again. Maybe have lunch here next week as we will be spending a day in port there, You can walk to most areas fro this location,but be very careful and watch out for pick pockets they are up to all kind of tricks,I was almost deceived so be very careful.
UR120315761	We stayed at the hotel for several nights post cruise during the middle of October. The hotel is in a wonderful area directly across the street from the Barcelona Cathedral. We enjoyed the outside patio restaurant and watching the performers and musicians in the square. The hotel also has a lovely bar, with lots of comfortable overstuffed chairs and sofas, for drinks, food, and conversation. There are lots of restaurants, coffee bars etc. in the area and it was an easy walk to visit the Gaudi houses. Our room was quite large with a huge bathroom and quiet, cold air conditioning - a huge bonus because it was so hot in Barcelona during our stay. The hotel is very well maintained and the staff was friendly and very helpful.
UR120080748	The hotel is perfectly situated across the square from the Cathedral in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Several restaurants are all within minutes walking distance and the views from the cathedral-side rooms is stunning. The building itself is classic and public areas are beautfully decorated. The rooms are (European) small and admittedly closing in on an update but they are very clean. The bathroom was modern and spotless. Sixth floor rooms have private verandas overlooking the cathedral, which is worth asking for. If your preference is big chain luxuries, go elsewhere. If you are interested in a true European hotel experience, book at the Hotel Colon.
UR119813556	The best feature of this hotel is the central location, right in the Gothic quarter. The building itself is very nice. The rooms however need some updating. The bed is not very comfortable and the linens could be much better. The staff is great though. The bar and restaurant are very pleasant
UR119718789	Stayed at this hotel Oct./10/11 2011. As other reviews have stated location is perfect, close to all the main attractions. Hotel staff were accomadating. Did not eat breakfast at this hotel as the fresh market was only 5 min. walk. If visiting Barcelona again I would stay at Hotel Colon.
UR119688159	The reviews that precede this review, and likely those that will follow it, point out the great location this hotel has, and it is indeed great. A fabulous view from the rooms facing the Cathedral, a short walk to the subway, and located right in between the Ramblas area and the Born district, you are likely only a 5-10 minute walk from most of the sites you will want to visit in the downtown area. That said, the hotel disappoints on several other important dimensions. We found the staff very uneven in terms of customer service. There was one front desk person who was excellent - friendly, helpful and very engaging. The same was true for one of the doormen/bellmen. But most of the others were unsmiling, unengaging, and manage to give you the impression your reasonable requests were getting in the way of them dealing with the more important business they had to do. A second pet peeve was security. The room keys are modern digital ones, but they have affixed them to incredibly large heavy key tags. The result is that there is no way you would want to take one out of the hotel with you. Fair enough, but the full extent of the security was simply asking to get the key to your room - no ID check, not even a question as to what your name was. I must have asked for my key 10 times over our 3 day stay, and I could easily have given any room number I wanted. And to reduce security further, you can see exactly what rooms have and have not claimed their key, so an ill intentioned individual would not easily make the mistake of asking for a key to a room where the key had already been given out. As is sometimes the case in older hotels, sound transmission between the rooms was a real problem. Our bed headboard was against the wall that the TV was on in the adjacent room. Even at low volume, we could hear their TV quit clearly when trying to sleep. On the plus side, we had a room on the third floor looking out over the Cathedral square, and the exterior noise proofing was quite good. Finally, a little anecdote that pretty much sums up the hotel for me. When we checked in, the first room they sent us to had a very distinct smoky smell to it. We commented to the bellman that we wanted a non smoking room. He told us that by law, in Spain, you could not smoke in a hotel room but that despite the law, some people broke the rules. My eagle eyed partner then asked him, if it was illegal to smoke in a hotel room, why did they provide ashtrays? He responded immediately, and with such a rehearsed answer that I am sure it is what they've been told to say, that the rooms were carpeted, and they would want a smoker to set fire to the carpet. Oddly, in no other hotel we stayed at in Spain did we encounter an ashtray.....and oddly we also did not encounter carpet burns either. Perhaps in recognition of these issues, the place was reasonably priced by BCN standards. All in all, book it if you want the location and can't get anything else at a reasonable price that is nearby. But be prepared for a few disappointments.
UR119682653	This is a lovely hotel in the historic Gothic section of the city (where Colombus brought back natives from the New World to show Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand). It sits on one side of a large square opposite the Barcelona Cathedral. The hotel has an outdoor terrace cafe on the square, and there is a good restaurant across the square. The lovely air-conditioned rooms in which my friends and I stayed faced the Cathedral. What a view! The staff was wonderful and accommodating. We were able to walk from the hotel to Las Ramblas, the waterfront, the Boqueria marketplace, shopping, and the Picasso Museum. If I go to Barcelona again, this is where I will stay.
UR119331543	We visited Spain in June 2010 and loved this hotel. Our balcony overlooked the cathedral and it was a good location for walking to most of the sights!! The breakfasts were excellent with a good variety and the hotel was very clean. We would definitely stay there again if we have the opportunity to return to beautiful Barcelona!
UR119211691	You really cannot beat this place for location! Right in front of the cathedral, at the entrance of the barri gotico, you're within 5 minutes walk from plaza Catalunya, Palau de la musica etc...This was my second stay there and the staff were much more helpful than I had remembered, and the building lived up to my memories of its lovely red marbled hall. Breakfast was also a treat with it's delicious melons and though I missed the churros, my figure was thankful for that omission, enough temptation with the iberic ham, chorizos! The rooms were fine and well equipped. My friend forgot her key on the door at night (too much sangria!) and it was very reassuring to find out that it was taken to reception by the night porter who does rounds ! I'd wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona, except maybe the Colon regencia as it is usually cheaper, but in this case the prices were identical as I had book directly on the hotel's site and got a very good deal.
UR119064967	.....or at least it is for me! I had a single room, which was basic with no view other than a blank wall – but then that is exactly what I expected and by central B. standards I didn’t think I paid a lot for it. It was if anything a little bigger than I expected and everything was clean and worked as it should. Very good safe at no extra charge. And as for the location, well you just couldn’t get any better. Walk out the front door into the cathedral square with the main entrance facing you, wonderful. Only used it as a base so can’t really comment too much on facilities, staff I encountered were friendly and helpful at all times. Didn’t use dining room, breakfast was not included in my deal (18 euros extra) and you can get excellent coffee and a pastry for a couple of euros at a plethora of cafes nearby. My best tips – Bus Touristic 2 day pass, hop on, hop off as you please, is great value. Also, when I went to Sagarda Familia at 10.30am I queued for over an hour, by the time I came out at about 2.0pm there was no queue! .. go in the afternoon.
UR118969974	We stayed here for 4 nights on our first ever trip to Barcelona, after reading in various travel guides that this hotel was highly recommended. We did love this hotel, only because it is old, authentic, and quaint, and perfectly located for exploring the Gothic Quarter/Barri Gotic, and all of Barcelona. The nearest subway stop is about a 3 minute walk away from which you can easily explore the further-flung attractions such as the beach, Sagrada Familia, etc. Yes, the Barri Gotic is full of tourists, but it is chock full of wonderful cafes, restaurants, and shops which serve tourists and residents alike. We wandered through the winding streets of the Barri Gotic after dark with no problem whatsoever. I would have to see the crime stats to believe that this area is not safe. The streets are full of people staying out at restaurants and cafes til 1 AM every night of the week. The front office staff, unfortunately, for the most part are cold and unfriendly, with a few notable exceptions, but they are knowledgeable and will answer all your questions. Our "basic" room faced the interior courtyard, and was very quiet and clean, but indeed basic. The twin beds, which we discovered are standard equipment for hotel rooms in Spain, came with surprisingly thin mattresses. The blankets, which we needed because the air conditioning could only be set to "meat-locker", were soiled and smelly, but were quickly exchanged for seemingly clean ones on request. There is an airport shuttle bus which leaves every 5 minutes or so from Plaza Catalunya, which is a 10-minute walk from the hotel, and is doable with wheeled luggage if you want to save on taxi costs. Overall, we were happy with this hotel as it is reasonably affordable, by Barcelona standards, particularly if you book online, and the location is unbeatable.
UR118820973	This hotel is located in the old heart of Barcelona. If you can get a room facing the cathedral square, there is constant action and local flavor. The rooms are just adequate, but do have a/c and a small fridge. Management is curt, sour and unpleasant. Breakfast is definitely not included in the rate, and, if you wish coffee, there is a sharp-eyed minder to ensure you're charged for it! Otherwise breakfast is 18 euros per person! Location is the only advantage to this hotel.
UR118571844	The Colon is in a great location opposite the old cathedral - not Sagrada Familia! Close to Las Ramblas, the port and Palau de la Musica. The rooms are comfortable and the staff are all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a very good buffet, along the lines of Paradors which probably provide the best breakfasts in Spain. There can be some street noise from revellers but I suspect that is true of all hotels in Barcelona. We always stay at the Colon when in Barcelona and I suspect we always will.
UR118570978	We were only there for one night at the end of our trip, and we were there at the beginning of a weekend festival, so I suspect we did not get the best room in the hotel. Still, the room was good, had plenty of room, good room safe. The bathroom had lots of room too, even two sinks. Our only view was of an interior courtyard, but it was very quiet as a result. Great location, right in the Gothic Quarter, in a pretty safe part of that quarter. The room did not have a clock or face cloths, but this was true of everywhere we stayed in Spain, so I don’t hold that against them. But if you don’t like to rely on wake up calls, bring an alarm clock. Very serviceable 4-star hotel. Not a lot of charm, but I would stay here again. Note this hotel is different from the Hotel Regencia Colon, although the two have similar websites, and are next to each other. Indeed, some of the pictures posted by reviewers are actually of the Hotel Regencia Colon. We stayed at the Hotel Regencia Colon at the beginning of our trip and we were supposed to stay there at the end of our trip. Instead, we cancelled and booked at the Hotel Colon, which was only 10 or 15 euros more, and it was definitely worth it.
UR118546870	They always say "Location,Location" is it! Well, what could be better than looking out your window to the beautiful Cathedrel in the plaza accross the street, also would enjoying a street fair entice you??? Well, we loved it, couldn't ask for nicer staff, very polite, courteous & helpful, with any questions or concerns. The accomodations were clean, & up to date. The elevator was a little out dated, but the porter was always there to help. We enjoyed dinner in the lovely dining room, great menu & courteous servers. The hotel also has a lovely little cafe outside to enjoy your cappacino or just people watch. We can't wait to go back!!
UR118245256	The Colon Hotel is ideally located across the square from the Cathedral and easy walking to Las Ramblas, tour buses, and good restaurants. Our favorite restaurant is Cake L'Academia just minutes from the hotel.
UR118242979	Would recommend this hotel for travelers concentrating on exploring Barcelona or, as in our case, a home base prior or post taking a Med cruise. The location of this property is excellent. It is within walking distance to the Cathedral, the Dali exhibit, and tons of restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. The Barcelona subway, or Metro, is also within walking distance. The hotel lobby and other public spaces were beautiful, featuring marble, brass, and polished wood. Our guest room and bath were surprisingly roomy (for European standards), and included robes, plenty of bathroom ammenities, an in-room safe, mini-bar, lots of lighted closet space, and a couple of English language channels on the TV. Everything in this hotel was sparkling clean and well maintained. The desk and food/beverage staff were very polite and helpful, spoke excellent English and even helped us with our attempts at Spanish. We checked in at about 9am, after an overnight flight in from JFK, only expecting the hotel to store our luggage until later in the day, but to our surprise (and eternal gratitude), they told us that our room was ready which allowed us a desperately needed power nap. The only very minor problem we had was not being able to locate a bottle opener in the room, as the water bottles don't have twist off tops. My husband went down to the desk and they gave him one of branded hotel openers from the bar. At the end of the stay, I tried to buy the opener as a souvenier, but was told to keep it, at no charge, with their complements. Very classy operation.
UR118242888	This is our second time at this hotel. We keep returning because of the location (and a reasonable price for such a prime area). This is an older (if not historic) hotel with all the charm of an upscale hotel of its time. It is right on the cathedral plaza in the old section, around the corner from the Picasso museum, and flanked by walk streets on all but one small side. There is always a party happening right outside the front entrance -- with music, older couples dancing, street performers, and a few antique stalls. Many, many cafes within 50 feet or a 5-10 minute walk. It is a 5 minute walk to La Rambla, 7 minutes to the Boquettia? Market, 7 minutes to Catalunya Sq. and the main Tourist/Info office, and about 7 min. to two different metro stops. The rooms themselves are older and well-maintained, but do show use. There is great A/C and a flat screen TV. The bathtub/shower had excellent hot water and a strong water pressure. There were double sinks in the bathroom. The room itself was kind of small, but each room is different. There is a turndown service including delicious chocolates. Our only complaint this time around was the amount of natural light in the room -- it was too dark, a function of the height of the building and being located on a small inner courtyard. A street or alley facing room might provide more sunlight, but watch out for the plaza facing rooms because of the possible noise (yet, they do have nice little balconies!). We recommend the Gothic city tour walk (from Tourist Office), visiting all the Gaudi sites, Hop On Hop Off bus at least one day to get an overview, and a day's visit to Montserrat (again booked thru the Tourist Office). The old monestary high in the mountains is spectacular. It is a metro ride to Plaza Espana, then 1 1/4 hr. train ride from BCN, then a special steep train or gondola to the Montserrat itself. Once there, besides the cathedral with the madonna, there are 2 teleferiques from which you can take 20min to 2 hour hikes. The view is incredible.
UR118187734	I really loved this hotel and the location is simply perfect. The staff at the hotel were both friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean and the communal areas are well decorated. I was pleased to find on arrival a bath robe, tooth brush and tooth paste, razor and shaving foam, shampoo, body lotion and shower gel. The safe is secure and easy to use and the mini-bar is well stocked and reasonably priced. The room is tidied and re-stocked each day. The hotel is right in the heart of Barcalona's vibrant and exciting Gothic area but is pleasantly peaceful and quiet at night.
UR118038204	We really enjoyed staying in this hotel. 1. Great location: just a few steps to metro, the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus, carpark, and the cathedral. It's in Bari Gothic area - we really enjoyed our evening walk around that district. 2. Great view: just right in front of the cathedral. Excellent!! 3. Staff: very informative. You will not go wrong with this hotel. We're really happy with this hotel.
UR118022559	We stayed at the Colon Hotel for 4 nights in August 2011. We made a reservation over the internet for a family room for 4 people as we were travelling with our two teenage sons. The room was great. In fact, it really was 1 room connecting into a second room, with a real door between the two (privacy !) each room with its own little balcony overlooking the Gothic Cathedral (right across the square). The air conditionning worked really well (a must in August) and the rooms were very clean. This is an old hotel that has been refurbished a few years ago. Slick and modern it is not and the lobby looks a little bland. But the hotel itself has a lot of old world charm. I would definitely go back there again because at a very reasonable price, it offers an excellent location, great comfort and uncompromising cleanliness. A very good deal indeed.
UR117903162	booked this hotel very lastminute and not sure waht to expect, but amazed at the quailty of the rooms and the helpfullness of the staff they could do enough for you. our room had a balsony overlooking the caterdal and the square beauiful. excellent location 10 mins walk from the ramblas and the port. grat resurants within 5mins.
UR117589651	The view from our room was breathtaking; overlooking the Cathedral. Just a short 3min stroll to La Ramblas and the best shopping. Service was great!!! Breakfast delicious.
UR117292421	We spent 13 nights here at the Hotel Colón in one of their top rooms: Double room with terrace overlooking the Cathedral, which was on the top floor of the hotel (accessible by two lifts and / or stairs). The hotel, which was used in the film 'Food of Love', is very well located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, and so in walking distance from many of the most famous and popular tourist attractions. However, the rooms are quiet retreats and the air conditioning is very good. Our room was very presentable, if a little small, and was clean and tidy. A range of toiletries (incl. tooth brushes) were provided. We had a turn-down service and little chocolates were left every night by our pillows. The TV has channels in German, Spanish, Catalan, English, French and Italian. The staff are very friendly and helpful and will print out boarding passes for free if you email them to the reception. Free Wi-fi is also available to hotel guests, but you need to ask for the code as this is not well publicised. The reception and restaurant staff speak excellent English and I heard them speaking good Italian and French, too. The restaurant is pricey, but worth going to once or twice and the bar is also a cozy place to chill in. The breakfast buffet is expensive but there is a good range of typical continental food and drinks on offer. Check in and check out were very smooth and the safe in the bedroom was free to use (unlike many comparable hotels in the city which charge). The terrace in our room was the real selling point - very spacious with tables and chairs and lovely plants. The view over the main square facing the Cathedral was brilliant and it was a great place to people watch in an evening. The room was also east-facing so you could see the sunrise every morning. Lovely!
UR116581961	Arriving to the Hotel I was thoroughly happy to see that it fit right in with the architecture of the environment. The staff was more than helpful. Although we don't speak spanish very well at all (our fault not theirs) communicating with the staff was not a problem at all. There was not one person who worked at the Hotel that didn't make us feel welcomed. They were courteous, friendly, very informative. The room met expectations, and I like the idea of leaving the key behind, no chance of losing it. But, I wish the guest they interact with were as friendly, I did witness some of the most rude people (guest) belittling the stafff for what ever reason. But the staff remained calm and professional. I will most definitely return and will also recommend this to others. The only thing I might do different this time is make the choice to get a room on the cathedral side but that is a personal choice if I decide to want the busieness of the night or the side street which also has a great view of the cathedral without the busieness, but either side will be comfortable. I was able to close off the sound by closing the windows and slept well. Overall this place is the best!!!!
UR116576114	Stayed for 3 nights on a trip across France, Spain and Morocco. Of all the hotels this was the best. Our hotel budget for our trip was $ 150 US per night so we ended up staying in some pretty sparse accomodations depending on location.. For this price at the Colon Hotel we were given a magnificent room with a great view of the square. All the staff were incredibly gracious and helpful. The restaurant is pricey but the food is worth it. Can't wait to come back.
UR116396091	We stayed at the Hotel Colon for two nights between a six-day stay in Venice and a seven-day Western Mediterranean cruise. As a family of four with two teenagers, we booked two (side-by-side) rooms on Expedia, paying $169 per night, per room (including taxes). We stayed in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona as part of a home exchange last year, so we were looking for a hotel in the same area – close to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. Since our one full day in Barcelona was also my birthday, I was inclined to err toward splurging slightly, rather than being more frugal. But I’m not sure I would have chosen a different hotel in any case. The Hotel Colon (not to be confused with its nearby neighbour the Hotel Regencia Colon) is a very comfortable property. It has a spacious lobby, with a sitting area and a large front desk. The attitude and service of the staff were friendly and professional. Before even seeing my room, I was very confident that I had chosen a very respectable establishment, which has a much higher-end feel, while still bearing a mid-range price. The hotel looks out on the plaza containing the Catedral di Barcelona (The Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia). The rooms were quite large, for a European hotel. They were more similar to hotel rooms in a standard North American business hotel. Although I booked “standard view” rooms, we were given complimentary “Cathedral view” rooms, which meant we could look out on the cathedral, plaza activities, cafes, etc from our rooms. Check-in was quick and easy. Check-out was a little slower, mainly because we waited until the last minute and were checking out at the same time as many other guests. Also, because of the set-up of the lobby area, there was more of a crowd than a line/queue around the check-out desk. As a result, at least one less-courteous guest pushed his way to the front rather than waiting in line. I had hoped the desk clerk would direct him to the back of the line, but I’m not sure he really realized that this fellow hadn’t waited his turn. But that was a minor annoyance and reflected more on the manners of the guest than on the service of the hotel. Here are my comments on recent posts about the Colon: • Smell – the hallways had a “freshly cleaned” smell, but I know people have different tastes, to “clean” to one is “too much air-freshener” to another • Wi-fi – the hotel had wi-fi, which was definitely spotty. But they did offer us a cable and we didn’t bother because we didn’t plan to spend much time on the internet • Cleanliness – our rooms, including the bathrooms were perfectly clean. We had no complaints • Room key – Either the recent poster or we completely missed the instructions about the room keys. We were never told to leave them with the front desk when we went out for the day. They were large and clunky, though. After the cruise, we were back in Barcelona for about eight hours. I stopped in at the front desk to ask for directions to the nearest laundromat and they were more than happy to help (and allowed me to use the washroom while I was there as well). I highly recommend the Hotel Colon. If I was looking for hotel accommodation in Barcelona again, I probably would just book the Colon without spending much or any time looking to see what other alternatives were available. The plaza area is vibrant without being too noisy at night or early in the morning. The hotel (like just about everything in the Gothic quarter) is only a couple minutes walk away from shops, cafes, restaurants and the very easy-to-use Barcelona metro system.
UR116344184	My son and I enjoyed everything about this hotel, except our room. It wasn't a room you wanted to hang out in, nor did it or the bathroom feel "scrubbed." Unfortunately, that is a deal breaker for me.
UR116234257	For anyone looking for a grand & old Barcelona style hotel, this is it! Staff were extremely helpful and obliging. The hotel is located near the shopping districts, port, and some amazing restaurants. Parked our car for 4 days, and walked everywhere! Definetely would go back. We managed to book our room 3 months ahead and received an excellent rate!
UR116133469	I stayed at the Hotel Colon for two nights in July 2011. Before I booked, I read all of the reviews on Trip Advisor and wondered which ones painted the truer picture -- the raves or the less-enthusiastic commentary. I decided to be optimistic and trust the good reviews. Unfortunately, when I arrived, I found that the bad reviews were more accurate. The hotel is not in the grand style of old Europe, as they claim, except perhaps in the fact that you have to deposit your key with the front desk every time you leave the hotel. (This means that you then have to stand at the front desk waiting for one of the staff to acknowledge you when you return.) Although the lobby is somewhat grand, the rest of the place does look like a Best Western from the 1980s. My room was dank, with water-stained floral wallpaper. The bed was small and hard. The chair's arms were black at the ends from the handprints of long-gone guests. The wireless worked only sporadically. And so on. The staff was professional, but prone to arguing with you if you voiced a concern. The one bright spot was the doorman, who was very friendly and helpful. In the end, it was a serviceable place to stay, and the location is truly great, but having now seen the other options available in Barcelona, I wish I had searched a little harder. Sorry, Hotel Colon. I hope you are able to make some upgrades soon, and trust that when you do, the hotel will be restored to its former glory.
UR116133176	Colon Hotel is conveniently located on the cathedral square in Barri Gothic, near public transportation, the Ramblas and the waterfront. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. We found the front desk staff to provide relatively poor concierge services, sending us to "tourist" establishments that were less than satisfying. Use tripadvisor and make reservations before you arrive. Note, we did like the location, but like much of Barcelona, there are pickpockets in this area. My wife had her wallet pulled from her purse and we watched a family have their backpack picked, both while sitting at the hotel street side cafe. Keep your valuable close!
UR116043653	I booked the site through Expedia almost 8 weeks prior to my arrival and paid €80 per night for the room. As my arrival date neared I checked the rates again and saw that they are substantially higher. It is good to book early I thought. Well... it is not good to book this hotel and a solo traveller through third party sites. I got a crap corner room which was ridiculously small and which stank. When I complained about the smell I was told that I could open the window or that they could put more air freshener. Problem is that the whole hotel is so strongly smelling of the air freshener that adding more to the mix would give a permanent headache. The decor was 2 star, bathroom was 2 star basic... service - it varied but it stayed at around that level too. WIFI is horrifically patchy and slow so they got me a cable which only reached half way to my bed and meant that I could rarely use it. I stayed here for three days. All better hotels were booked and overly expensive so I did not have a choice but to stay. This really made my stay in Barca quite bad. Oh and I asked for a let check-out - no chance.
UR116009441	We are a family of 3, with a 15 years old daughter very demanding and fastidious. The location is perfect, professional hotel staff so kind and helpfull. They have a great breackfast. We will definitely return to Barcelona and to this great hotel
UR115978534	Stayed here for five nights and it was a bit of a mixed bag. I am not sure if some of the rooms have been renovated with other being left from the early 90's. Carpet was a sea foam green with decor of white with rose curtains, chair fabric and artwork. The lobby is nice with marble and wood. The restaurant (at least for breakfast) was through the bar area and down stairs. The buffet (included in room price) had a fairly good selection of item types (pastries, coffee, tea, juice, eggs, yogurt, ham/bacon, etc.), but the quality of the eggs was poor as they were very runny and almost grainy...still, you will find something to start your day and keep you until lunch. My room was on the third floor with a window facing the small street behind the hotel. The window opens (good since the room had a faint cigarette smoke smell...not uncommon in European hotels I think). With the windows closed the room was quiet with little outside noise. With the window opened you could hear people at a nearby pub. Other rooms face the cathedral and the adjoining square. The square is a very active and lively place so I imagine there could also be some noise with the windows open on that side as well. This is a large city so that should not be unexpected, just know that the windows are newer and well insulated against sound. There was some noise from the hallway, as some of my neighbors for the first night or two appeared to be younger and a little louder. Also, the air conditioning worked well. The internet was spotty at times and good for light use only (no big files or video). Calls to the front desk to reset the router usually got things running again. Staff in general was helpful. Summary: Great location and clean, don't expect much in the way of room decor.
UR115888211	This hotel was part of a nice experience of a weekend in Barcelona. Initially we were a little sceptical as the staff welcome was limited to say the least. They were quite businesslike with limited chit chat, as though we were just more guests on a temporary stay. We were able to communicate in English with them and ask questions, and receive informative answers, they offered help with info about the city on arrival. However, we just got the impression that they had done it all before and were a bit tired. Socially. On entry to the room, there was a musty smell, but with the balcony doors open, this dissipated and was not a concern for the rest of the stay. We had paid extra for a room with a view of the Cathedral, and yes, we could see the Cathedral, - through two big leafy trees, but if you used your imagination, you could just about conjour it up. We will be writing to the Hotel about this to see what they have to say. It was however, really wonderful to be able to open the balcony doors in the morning and listen to the goings on of the square and any music there was out there. It was a highlight for me, I don't think you would get that experience many other places. The room was clean and the bathroom was clean and big enough. Slightly disturbing window / cupboard above the toilet which housed the grubby plumbing and pipes etc. but leaving that closed for the duration reduced any mild anxiety about this. I had googled the Hotel to check re gym facilities, and had been bamboozled by the results so was unsure if there was a facility there or not when I arrived. There isn't, just to clarify. Free internet is slow and tempermental. Nice chocolates when they turned down the bed, but only one evening out of 2.
UR115775452	we along with 2 other couples stayed one night after a cruise. the hotel was in the gothic area of barcelona on the square across from the cathedral. this was a good location for exploring the gothic quarter and the church where queen isabella blessed columbus on his voyage. there were nice restaurants within walking distance. the square was busy with many people. the hotel was old world, with nice rooms. our friends had great suites overlooking the square. the front desk was helpful and warned about the pick pockets in the square. it was several blocks over to the ramblas. our room was quiet and comfortable for sleeping. the desk helped with securing taxis the next am for the trip to the airport. it cost ~$41 euros for each cab plus tip, which we thought was expensive. we used barcelona tours for airport pick up and should have used them for the return trip. it cost $89 for all of us in a nice big van which carried all four of us plus the luggage. It was nice to split our trip with a stay on the ramblas and then one on the cathedral square.
UR115764221	Everything about this hotel was wonderful. The staff was super friendly and very helpful! The room was very clean. A perfect location, within walking distance to nearly everywhere. I would stay there again on my next trip and would for sure recommend it to anyone. It was absolutly perfect for what I needed as a single traveller for 4 days, with free wi-fi in the room, which worked perfectly for me.
UR115747792	Friendly, efficient service. Arrived early in the morning after a cruise, they stored our luggage and got our room ready by lunchtime. The superior room with four beds had a view of the cathedral, sound proof doors, a/c, and it was roomy (two bedrooms) with a fantastic, large bathroom with two sinks and good shower. The hotel's lift in good working order. The location is unbeatable. Drug store, souvenir shops, restaurants, cafes and sightseeing bus stop within meters. Good, sufficient breakfast for families. Las Ramblas is a five minute walk with all the gothic quarters wonderful winding alleyways to explore in between. Great for small children. Hard bed but not uncomfortably so.
UR115631808	We stayed twice, eight days before and two after a cruise. This was a Family Trip and they accommodate my two childrens and their family in rooms for the couple and two children. Their rooms were big and beautiful. The first room I got the floor carpet was not too clean, but the second time this other room was very nice. The personnel at the Front Desk is excellent, very helpful and professional. Everyone was excellent except a mature man that worked at the breakfast room that was always complaining. Next time we come to Barcelona this will be our Hotel...Thanks Ana and all.
UR115426023	I have stayed in a lot of 2 and 3 star hotels, but this was my worst experience by far. I realize traveling solo might mean getting a smaller room, but it shouldn't mean getting shoved into a corner into a room that you can't open the window for safety reasons. The pics should beautiful balconies overlooking the plaza. Not if you are alone. You get a view of a dirty courtyard area and other rooms. (I will post pictures at a later date.) This window opened to a green turf terrace easily accessed by anyone. No fresh air was possible. The entire hotel smells like horrible perfume based air freshener. The shower fills up with water. When I reported that and the constantly running toilet, nothing was done. Also, there was no lighting for the shower part of the bathroom. Thie decor is gaudy floor to ceiling paisley design wallpaper. The wifi rarely worked. if you want to be ink the old section by the cathedral, the location is great. I still would not recommend this hotel.
UR115388039	Leticia was so helpful, getting us tickets for the sightseeing bus and a wonderful 4 guitarists concert at discounts. Our seats for the concert were in the front row! She was professional and attentive to our needs, always. Great hotel. We would stay there again.
UR115367310	We are a family of 5 and picked this Hotel based on previous reviews. For us this was a great value and a great hotel! We had 2 rooms and with the US dollar so weak, this was an excellent choice for the price paid. The location was a central square that was perfect for walking around. The hotel restaurant was excelleant, breakfast was good The rooms we clean well furnished, bath room large and the bed queen sized. Our room had a window that opened to inside of the hotel, no view but plenty of light. The room had plenty of closet space and mini bar. We enjoy our rooms and had no complaints.
UR115305945	So being my first trip to Europe I wanted to stay in a grand hotel with big floor to ceiling doors overlooking the city. This did not disappoint, we had a superior room overlooking the Cathedral booked but were upgraded to a suite overlooking the Cathedral when we arrived. Wow, it was beautiful, the view was perfect and even though you would think that it would be loud next to a Cathedral it was not, the doors seemed to be sound proof when closed. This was a beautiful hotel and had an amazing breakfast in the morning that was included with our room, internet was also included. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks for making our first impression of Europe such a good one.
UR115232439	We stayed here late June 2011 and was hugely disappointed. I am shocked by the number of excellent reviews here because even if we had an excellent stay, the hotel would lose points solely on the fact that the rooms are totally outdated. We are talking old wallpaper from the 80s, dated furniture and linens my great grandmother would have used. The location is right across from the cathedral but very busy and loud. We stayed the night of st. John the baptist's day (evidently a huge holiday) and fire crackers went off all night from 7 pm until 6 a.m. The front desk staff are very pompous- we never got an appropriate welcome when we arrived. Upon checkout, we were never asked about our stay. Also, The Wifi does not work even though it says wifi which was a huge disappointment since we needed to be in touch with family back in the states. The area is also shady- random people will approach you so keep your guard up. I would recommend another hotel with friendly staff is a nicer part of town.
UR115156549	I've stayed there 2 nights in July, with my boyfriend. The decoration of the room was very old, and we felt like staying in a regular B&B. And also, although very central, I dont think the location of the hotel is ideal, which is located next to one of the busiest squares, with a lot of noise and street lights all on during the night. Fortunately, the noise isolation of the windows was OK, and there were black thick curtains so we could sleep with the windows and black curtains closed as sleeping in a cave. I am very dissapointed with the hotel, which I had booked after reading the reviews here and wouldnt recomment unless it is half price.
UR115125911	Excellent historical hotel right on the Cathedral plaza. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and windows are soundproof. Beds are comfortable including a rollaway bed we requested for our son. It is obvious that cleanliness is of utmost importance to them. The nightly turn down service includes scrumptious small boxes of cholocate that we still dream about. The hotel lobby is large and it is adjacent to an even larger TV room with numerous channels which makes it very convenient when several TV enthusiasts are staying in the same room. In this room you can also find newspapers, magazines and bar service if desired. The Hop On and Off tour buses stop a few feet away from the hotel entrance. Restaurants, bars, stores, The Ramblas, Paseo de Gracia and museums are all within walking distance. The location of this hotel makes you feel that the different cultural activities taking place on the plaza at all times are right in your own living room. A Bell Hop is usually standing outside the hotel entrance to open the door and welcome guests as they return to the hotel. Security is tight and cameras can be seen all over the hotel corridors and public areas. Internet rates are usually better that those of the hotel.
UR115121048	We used the Colon Hotel for our recent family trip to Barcelona. The main reason at the time to select this hotel is that is one of the few that will fit a family of 4 in a single room. From the moment that you enter the Colon Hotel you can see the classic furnishing and decoration. The Colon Hotel is a classic old school hotel, elegant decor and furniture just like you see in the pictures of the site. What the pictures do not tell you is that the Hotel has a new refresh feeling to it, all looks classic and vintage but smells really good and fells fresh, not like an old hotel that feels and smells old. I am usually a modern hotel type of consumer, but this hotel has his charms and is really good. Good things to point out: - Free very good WI-FI in the entire Hotel including the room at no additional charge. -Superb staff, they will accommodate to your needs and very friendly. -Great breakfast buffet every morning on level (-1) -Great restaurant and sidewalk cafe -Great location and rooms. The only improvement that it will need to my opinion is the bed and pillows. The bed was king of hard and the mattress was thin, also the pillows were really thin (but they provided several). I do not know if this mattress type is typical in Europe, but made me miss the bed of the last Radisson Hotel stay.
UR115087915	Just what we needed from a city hotel; best central location, very easy walk to almost all tourist spots, friendly staff, excellent - but expensive - dining. Very convenient car parking, also expensive by our standards, but relatively cheap by Barcelona standards. Highly recommended
UR114899904	Stayed here last week after booking through a third party travel site. Got what I knew was a good offer and happily booked. Booked in early January and stayed mid June When I arrived I was told that there had been a booking error with the prices and my booking shouldnt of been that price. Manager told me I had to pay an extra 200 Euros for the room on the spot. I pointed out that I have my reciept for the room at the price i paid. He was very abrupt explaing that it was a pricing error (he did admit that it was an error of the hotel) but still made it my problem) He threaten to cancel my booking at leave me with out a hotel for the night at 6pm in the evening after arriving into Barcelona. After many arguments I agreed to pay extra, just to avoid being with out any accomadation for the night. I am now in the progress of taking this further as I had paid for a room and then they demanded more on arrival. In terms of the hotel, the lcoation is fantastic but the decor and the actual fittings are extremelly old and is in need of a complete refresh. 2 Single beds pushed together, not even a double! Hope the manager is treated the same way he treated me when he decides to take a break from work. Will return to Barcelona soon, but never will stay here again!
UR114648165	Nice hotel with a great location. I would stay here again. We did not eat at the restaurant but the bar was nice and had good sangria.
UR114316071	I stayed here as part of a tour group but then extended my stay for 2 more days. I had a single room that was small but very comfortable, attractively furnished and had everything I needed. The hotel is very beautiful, old world style. You feel at home here quickly. The buffet breakfast is in a basement room that is very pretty and the food is good. The staff is very attentive to your needs and I was able to get my breakfast for no additional cost which I greatly appreciated. The biggest and most important reason to stay here is that it is in a fabulous location. I don't think it could be better located. You are on a huge square opposite the Cathedral. La Ramblas is about 5 minutes away. The old quarter is right there and I spend an afternoon just exploring the winding and lovely streets. The last time I stayed in Barcelona I was near Placa Catalunya and this location is so much better in my opinion. Placa Catalunya is about 12 minutes away but I only went there 2 times in the 4 days. The Picasso museum is right on the square. The shopping is terrific. I found a little shop around the corner where I got T shirts for 6 Euros each XL. Everywhere else they were about 12-18 Euros for the same exact shirt. You can sit outside in one of the hotels umbrella tables and people watch. They also have a sister hotel almost attached to this hotel on a back street. It is called the Hotel Colon Regencia. That hotel has a very plain lobby. I didn't see the rooms. There are several restaurants on the square but I headed for Les Quince Nits on Placa Reial 15 minutes away. My only negative is that my ipad didn't work at all there.
UR113716528	I was traveling solo and needed a safe, convenient hotel for a one night stay before taking a cruise that departed from Barcelona. This hotel was perfect. I opted for a room directly across from the Cathedral--a neat view. When you need a place to recover from jet lag--it was perfect. Located in the Gothic District, I had a great place to meander and get lunch before an afternoon nap. After that I walked over to La Rambla for a nice dinner. No need for taxi rides--until the next morning to the pier (not too far away). Never got them to fix the in-room safe (points off for service), but did use the safe deposit boxes just off the lobby. (So glad I stayed here rather than the Monte Carlo.)
UR113671229	This hotel has comfortable rooms and very good service. Breakfast is excellent. Located opposite the Cathedral, it is easily accessible (for example, if you come by airport shuttle to Placa de Catalunya) and provides an excellent basis for exploring the city. Train station is also within walking distance, if you plan to visit nearby towns along the coast.
UR112651511	Perfect location - especially for those who know nothing about Barcelona. It is right across the square from the Cathedral....a couple of blocks from Las Ramblas. The hotel was well kept, attractive, clean (well, the carpet could use a bit of attention), pleasant staff, reasonable price, very nice breakfast....We truly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it for your stay in Barcelona.
UR112459133	did lots of cross referenced research and very happy that I chose this hotel. I got a top floor room and bargained by e-mail to have breakfast and all taxes included. Location was great as were the staff, room and service. AC was fine and room was quiet. Would stay here again. We are very experienced world travelers married 45 yrs and I would certainly rate this as worth more than we paid.
UR111191479	We only stayed 1 night before getting on our cruise but we were really impressed. The hotel and it's staff are a wonderful example of Old World style. They were so helpful from start to finish, and located right on the square where they are, could not have worked out better for exploring the Gothic Quarter.We loved it there.
UR111035037	I highly recommend this hotel. We were a group of 12 people on a family reunion trip and stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and the hotel staff was extremely accomadating, welcoming and helpful. Loved the rooms and especially the location of the hotel. Walking distance to La Rambla and the city tour buses. I would definitley stay here again rather than the noisy La Rambla street. Also, outside the hotel is the beautiful historic cathedral worth checking out. All in all a great experience. The breakfast was good as well with fresh orange juice which was yummy.
UR110784789	We were very impressed with this hotel. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant, the room totally adequate with a big (by European standards) bathroom including full bathtub and shower, hairdryer and all amenities. The housekeeping staff kept our room very clean and the complimentary evening turn-down service included a little box of deluxe chocolates on each pillow. The beds were comfortable, there was sufficient closet space, and the small balcony had sound-proof doors that kept the room surprisingly quiet in the evening. The hotel restaurant looked very posh but the prices were a bit high so we checked out the numerous restaurants in the area offering terrific menus. Having not been to Barcelona before, we were very pleasantly surprised that this hotel is such a great, central location, right on the Catedral Plaza. We walked everywhere from here; La Rambla, Palau de la Musica Catalana, Picasso Museum, fabulous shopping, all just minutes away. It is also a very reasonable walk to Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, Passeig de Gracia and Sagrada Familia. The hotel is appropriately rated as a four star, the only thing keeping it from being a five star might be the slightly aged decor and furnishings. We would highly recommend this hotel!
UR110608975	Great location to gothic quarter and las ramblas. Great staff - and to refute another trip advisor members comments on the concierge, I found them to be extremely helpfull; I also primarily dealt with the gentleman with brown curly hair and he was nothing short of excellent. The only aspect of the hotel that could use improvement is the decor in the rooms as its a bit dated, however that seems to match the area being we are in the gothic quarter. I stayed in 4 hotels during my recent Spain excursion and this one stands out as an excellent experience.
UR109809524	This is the perfect spot for the first time visitor to Barcelona. We had a pleasant room with a marvelous terrace overlooking the cathedral. The difficuty was with the reception staff. There was a problem with the amount we were to be charged, which was fairly quickly resolved. However, the concierge staff was hopeless. We were confirmed at one of the top restaurants for our final night, only to find out on arrival that the establishment was closed on Mondays. One fellow in particular was less than helpful and far from courteous. He's a chubby man with curly brown hair. (Carlos?) Steer clear of him, if you want to enjoy Barcelona!
UR109720341	This hotel, while older, is in an excellent location, across from the Cathedral in the Gothic quarter. The rooms are spacious, and well appointed. The ones with the balconies in the front section (we had two) were very charming. Staff at the desk, porters, maid staff and restaurant staff were so nice and helpful. The breakfast is particularly good and quite varied. Dinner was superb. Close to everything.
UR109378495	Our room was a superior triple. I did see 15 other rooms that belonged to my group,. Overall the rooms were fine. They were bright and cheerful. They have the old world charm. The beds were comfortable. The linens were nice and the amenities were plentiful. Mixed reviews from the people in the group about the restautant, from just okay to fabulous. The front desk was not uber friendly, but they got the job done. The wifi was iffy, but if you had a cable for your computer you coudl internet for free in your room. Plenty of nice restaurants nearby. Only a short walk to the famous las Ramblas. Twnety minute walk to the ocean. This is not a 4 star Sheraton, but a 4 star European Hotel in all its glory.
UR108640766	We stayed 6 nights in the Colon Hotel in Barcelona. An old famous hotel right opposite the cathedral. Because of the noise in Barcelona, also at nights, we had a room on the backsite with huge terras, so we didnot have the view of the cathedral. The room was very silent. The airco you could arrange yourself; we used the airco only one hour before sleeping. We booked a superior room: spacious with 2beds. The breakfast offered evrything you wanted, with a special fresh orange-juice-machine. The staf was very attentive and always some older men. There was a huge lounch to sitdown and a nice terras to drink, in front of the hotel. Around the hotel there were no cars allowed. The hotel was in the very center of the town; everything was in walking distance.
UR103772936	I love this hotel for its location and its convenience to everything. There is little in Barcelona that is not within walking distance from this hotel. It's near the metro and a few steps away from a taxi stand if you need transportation. It's not a modern hotel but for those who require cleanliness, charm, convenience, and a marvalous plaza outside your door, this is a great option. I've stayed here four times. You would think management would acknowledge my loyalty, however they did not. But I would stay here again.
UR103176141	The hotel is an older hotel, but having said that, it still was very rundown in our room. We did not request a room with a view, so maybe that was a mistake. The bathroom shower was very, very moldy. The room was a nice size, but the rug was stained. For the price( that we booked on Expedia ) I expected a newer bath area and no stains on rug. Also, for those who enjoy breakfast, make sure that it is part of your hotel rate, because it was 18 euros (yes, that's $27) and really very ordinary. The staff was very nice.
UR103082092	Our first trip to Barcelona was made extra special by the wonderful staff at the hotel Colon. Cleanliness was excellent throughout, our room was spacious with a large balcony at the rear of the hotel which enjoyed the evening sun, The king size bed was very comfortable and extra pillows were delivered minutes after the request. The hotel is situated in the Barri Gotic area (opposite Barcelona Cathedral) which was ideal for all the main attractions, hopping onto the Metro (which was spotlessly clean) or bus/tram was a great way to get around the city. We found an excellent restaurant La Dolca Herminia just five minutes walk away from the hotel - excellent value!
UR102414574	My husband and I stayed at the Colon for a few nights in mid-March and had a wonderful experience. The staff was helpful and courteous, the room was spacious, tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean with a large terrace. Bathrooms came equipped with luxurious terrycloth robes. The location couldn't be better--an easy walk to Las Ramblos, to the beaches and port--with several nearby metro stops and the airport bus only a quick walk away. We loved Barcelona and want to go back and we would definitely stay at the Colon.
UR95169860	Beautiful, quiet hotel tastefully decorated with an incredible staff and management that couldn't do enough, especially Gregory and manager Leticia. Perfect location facing the Cathedral, steps from La Rambla, museums, etc. Luxurious yet warm and informal, with reasonable rates, I cant imagine why anyone would want to stay anywhere else in Barcelona.
UR94806763	I thought I had booked the Regencia Colon Hotel (and been checking TA for reviews etc), only to find on arrival my booking was with Hotel Colon – this was a pleasant surprise as Hotel Colon is the bigger of the sister hotels that are only 50 or so meters apart!! The location of the hotel was superb. Right on the edge of a square overlooking the Cathedral, and an easy walk to La Rambla which is full of restaurants and shops. We ate breakfast at the hotel on one occasion, but found it quite expensive, so opted for the little patisserie across the square to pick up our breakfast. The front desk staff were very helpful, on our first night having arrived at 11pm (just after room service finished), we went down to ask if anywhere would still be open to get something to eat – one of the gentlemen at the desk (sorry I can’t remember his name) recommended a place, and even walked us out to Via Laietana to point to the restaurant/bar which was across the road. We found this a very friendly, welcoming gesture. Our room was very large and clean, and even with windows overlooking the Cathedral, we hardly heard any noise of a night time. The only slight disappointment was that our room had 2 single beds joined together, but due to our short stay we didn’t bother making a fuss about it.
UR91365689	Excellent central hotel. Right across from the cathedral so there is no way you could get lost, just head for the cathedral. Also in a pedestrian only area, which is a real plus. Room was very spacious and clean. Was really surprised when we got a balcony looking over to cathedral as I thought this would have been extra. Staff were absolutely wonderful, nothing was a problem. We had a problem with our luggage, British Airways lost it and kept fobbing us off. In order for us to enjoy our holiday and not waste any time, one of the gentlemen on the front desk (sorry can't remember his name) took all our flight information and was phoning the airline for us whilst we were out. Staff were also really informative, giving out plenty of information about the city. So all in all this hotel is absolutely wonderful. Really high class and reminds me of an old glamorous hotel from the 20s. Loved it and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. Thanks for making our stay so great.
UR90023672	The Hotel Colon is of the Old School in the best sense of the phrase. It is luxurious without losing its charm, it is classy without being exclusive. Its location is perfect, the rooms spacious and well-equipped. The reception and hall staff are very good and welcoming. The breakfast is copious; the fresh orange particularly to be commended. Very small suggestion: the breakfast staff could wait until the client is comfortably seated and into their breakfast before asking discretely for their room number.
UR87972352	If you are visiting Barcelona for business or sightseeing this is just the perfect location. This grand turn of the century hotel has a central lovely lobby and small lobbies to chat with friends or relax and enjoy the setting. Right oposite the cathedral & pedestrian paved area but somehow without irritating noise as this is an elegant part of town. We had a wonderfully big room, we could have paid more for a view but decided not to as the inner courtyard was quiet and pleasant. Staff were helpful, professional and friendly
UR86381913	This hotel was a very nice place to stay. It's location is ideal for walking to many of the great sites in town and to hop on the hop-on, hop-off daily tour bus, which we took to not only see the city but use it for our way of getting to the sites we wanted to see. Warning about the hotel's location. It is right on a plaza that has exhibitions all the time. If your room faces the plaza, you'll hear the constant construction of the exhibits all day and into the early evening. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel. The staff was very efficient and helpful, the room was adequate, and the location is great.
UR85995862	We had three different rooms at this hotel in five days as the result of a train strike that kept us in Barcelona longer than expected. The staff (who were uniformly friendly and professional) were most helpful in extending our reservation, even giving us special rates for the extra two nights. We had originally booked a standard double cathedral-view room but arrived to find that we had one (room 607) with a partial cathedral view and a lovely terrace. The paint, upholstery and carpet in the room were rather tired but it was otherwise very comfortable and had a great bathroom set at an angle to the bedroom. The second room (128) was a superior double and our least favorite of the three. It was quite spacious (with a twin bed in addition to the double) and had high ceilings, hardwood floors and nice built-ins, but it had an uninteresting street view and was noisy. The third room (604) struck us as probably the best in the whole hotel; like the others it wasn't luxurious but it was large and quiet and pretty, with green wicker furniture to match the headboard and a painted design above the bed, and a spectacular terrace directly facing the facade of the Cathedral. . The lobby, bar, dining room and basement-level breakfast room are all gorgeous, with beautiful furnishings, and appear to have been recently updated. We had the buffet breakfast once and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also enjoyed the sardana dancing in the square in front of the hotel on Saturday night, and people-watching at the cafe on the sidewalk. We had drinks in the bar to listen to the piano player and dinner in the restaurant and that, too, was a very nice experience; the service and menu were really very elegant and the meal came with a complimentary appetizer and glass of cava. As other reviewers have said, the location of the hotel is perfect; with the exception of Park Guell, to which we took a taxi, we were able to walk to all the major attractions. We felt fortunate to have such a lovely hotel to be stranded in. We would not hesitate to return there if we are ever again in Barcelona.
UR84394097	I had reservations for the Regencia Colon but they upgraded us to the Colon. Our stay was most enjoyable. The location was excellent and since I made the reservation far in advance I received a discount on the room and breakfast included. I thought the buffet was excellent. The staff was fine and they made a few restaurant recommendations. One of them, Taller de Tappas was very good. We went back a couple of more times. The room was very good and evrything was very convenient.
UR84074619	Though they told they were wheelchair accessible, they are not. Our standard size wheelchair did not fit into the elevator. There was a stair lift to get into the lobby, the elevators to the rooms was too small. She had to get out of the chair and the chair had to be folded to fit into the elevator. Whne I asked to speak to a manager, there was never one on duty - for 5 days.
UR84046110	If the beds were not so hard, this would be a high recommendation. Very nice, elegant, older style hotel at a good location. But, the bed was extremely firm -- even for Spain. Would recommend IF you can sleep in a very firm bed.
UR80008390	We enjoyed the location of this hotel, although it is on a busy square near the Cathedral (not the Gaudi church.) Our room - "overlooking" the cathedral was on the second floor- tree line. If you really want to see the square, request a higher floor. Bar and restaurant are in the hotel. We skipped the buffet breakfast and went to Starbucks across the street. We found an Italian restaurant (la locanda) in the area and ate there three times! The doors off the balcony kept the room quiet. The hotel is air conditioned and has an elegant feel to it. The Gothic area around it is interesting to explore.
UR79925290	The Hotel Colon is in a great location, but it takes more to have a good visit. The rooms are fine for the price but employee attitudes are downright obnoxious. They don't have a Concierge, and the employees in the Reception area are unfriendly and at, best rude. The area around the Hotel is dangerous. I would suggest that you find a different place to stay if you go to Barcelona.
UR79678315	We only stayed there one night, so my experience is limited. I can safely say though that I didn't really like the hotel. It is situated in the heart of the old city, but that's the only thing going for it. Service was average and there were very few amenities. Everything in the rooms seemed old - in a bad way. The showers have no curtains or any covers so you can't take a shower without making the whole bathroom floor very wet. The walls are very thin: We heard the screams of a woman having sex upstairs, and they were VERY loud. Luckily, we didn't hear much else though. There's nothing to be enjoyed in this hotel and nothing going on at all. Even the location is not perfect since the area is not the safest at night. So I can only imagine this hotel being convenient for an early-to-bed old couple with a medium budget who just want a clean place to stay in heart of the city.
UR79484697	what a shame for a hotel, conveniently placed across the cathedral, Unfortunately our experience is very much on the contrary to most comments- pickpockets and robers are a huge problem and please Hotel Catalonia and Catalonia in general do something about it, here is what we experienced just this week: - We were in Barcelona, from 7th till 11th September, 2010 - On the night of 9th, sitting opposite the Cathedral , at the street restaurant of Hotel Colon (why sit inside in such good weather), my husband's mobile was stolen from our table in just a second - we were sitting next to a security camera - Apart from one waiter with empathy, all waiters and waitresses and also the receptionist, showed no sympathy, feels hostile when you are just robbed, they all said: '' oh, this happens all the time'', so why not warn us against it or make your camera work? or at least show some empathy? what about putting a smal note of warning on tables, with notes? there are notes in bathrooms about where to place towels so why not advise about mobile phones on tables too? - we asked for the police and were told they would not come there (why not take fingerprints from the table) - another coincidence: as we search for the police station, we meet a couple whom we got to know on the plane, and guess what ? their handbag with passports was stolen in an instant at the very same location, hotel colon's restaurant the night before! the rest does not concern hotel colon but curiosly it all happened on the very same night: - the nearest station we went to was the spanish police (they said they were not responsible), and all this time we were explaining we had seen the face of the robber and additionally there had been a security camera opposite our table, a translator young lady appeared, not at all empathic and gave us the address of the catalonian police, just then a german elderly couple walked in, the lady's necklace was stolen! - the address was wrong and when we finally arrived at the right address, like 2 kms off the address we were originally given, we realized this translator lady in civil clothes was already sitting and chatting with somebody at this correct address? a civil police who gives the wrong address and arriving there earlier than we do? (now, why do we say the wrong address? we were given an address at catalunya square, but the taxi drivers and cafe workers on the square say there is no such station there) - we were immediately asked if we saw the face of the robber (ı won't call him a pickpocket), we said yes, and off we go -were immediately sent- to a new station this time another 500 m to 1 km away - when we arrived there, we were told, the system was down (were shown the screen as a proof for a mere second, could not really see what it was) , complaint can't be done manually, and were asked to come back next day, (so what happens to the fingerprints on the table during all this time?) - another coincidence: as we search for the new police station, we meet a couple whom we got to know on the plane, and guess what ? their handbag with passports was stolen in an instant at the very same location, hotel colon's restaurant the night before! they did not say they saw the face of the robber, and their complaint was filed the night before! - hotel colon did not agree to show the camera recording , the police confirmed they did not have to , but the police also did not share any willingness at least to our face, to have a look at the recordings - consequently, we were suspicious that this was not all a coincidence - guess what? our tour leader's backpack was opened close to the Cathedral again, the next day! , fortunately he was aware of the danger and had nothing valuable inside, - it was almost 11:30 p.m. , were all very stressed and stopped by a restaurant and complained about what happened, the restaurant owner was not Spanish and said this happens to 1 in 3, that the city does nothing about this
UR79244153	Great location. Rooms small. Good breakfast after breakfast it was very nice to take our coffee out to the sidewalk in front of the hotel. Service not as good as you exspect in a 4 star hotel. When out closed the window you could not here anything from the plaza infront of the hotel even ( our room was on first floor ). Would stay there again.
UR79073134	Not having been to Spain before, I was prepared for some disappointments. But this hotel was a gem! The location was top-notch, rate was reasonable, it was clean and the rooms were charming. I'd definitely stay there again.
UR77125677	We arrived in Barcelona after a long plane ride from the US. Since it was early our room was not ready but we were allowed to store our luggage and the lobby was very comfortable. Soon we were told the room was ready and it was an upgrade. Nice size room with nice bath and every amenity one would need. The personnel were very helpful. The air conditioning worked well; the towels were large. The location is great. Away from the Ramblas but within walking distance. The price was quite reasonable for such a lovely hotel. It deserves a four star rating.
UR75891823	My husband, myself and 20 year old son recently stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Colon. The room was great and able to accomodate the 3 of us with a roll away bed for my son. The location was great - within the Gothic quarter and close to Las Ramblas. A great shop across the square with wonderful croissants. Also close to the Tourist Bus stop. Would stay there again if ever in the city. The staff was helpful and all spoke English.
UR75752166	During our 3-weeks trip in France & Spain, we’ve previously booked a room at the Regencia Colón Hotel in Barcelona for 3 nights (July 28 – 31, 2010). However, upon reaching the reception, we were told that our reservation has been moved to the more upscale 4 stars Colón Hotel across the street for the same price! Imagine our luck! As a result, we had an amazing double room for 86€/night on the 2nd floor (with a balcony) overlooking the Cathedral and we couldn’t have been happier with the amenities, value and location. The hotel is beautifully decorated in the lobby and the location is simply perfect in the Gothic Quarter. GOOD: The reception service was impeccable with all the staff speaking English fluently as they strived to make you comfortable from the start. We already felt that we lucked out with the change of our reservation and this hotel provided the perfect home for our incredible Barcelona experience. The room was extremely clean, tastefully decorated and very spacious with some really high ceilings. The basket of toiletries provided in the bathroom was remarkable in its selection. We found the door key to be really interesting as it was composed of a very heavy metal piece along with an electronic key component that you fitted into the slot (needless to say, you couldn’t really carry this key around so we always left it at the reception). The free Wi-Fi was supposed to be available only in the lobby, but as our room was just above, I had no difficulties surfing the net on my iPhone from the comfort of my own bed.;) BAD: Our 2 joint double beds tended to slide apart during the night, but it was probably due to the well polished wooden floor. The space around toilet was a bit crowded by a bidet, so much that for a person of my size, I was forced to sit on it somewhat sideways ;) (then again…that’s probably the only negative memory from an otherwise unbelievable hotel). PARKING: Finding our way to the hotel with a rental car was an adventure in itself due to the very tight one way streets. It is very easy to miss the right street to approach the hotel so a result, at one point, we found ourselves driving on the famous La Rambla out of all the streets and we had to circle around quite frustrated for some time. In the end, we were able to find our way by taking Via Laietana south and then entering Carrer de les Magdalenes all the way to the hotel. Parking is quite expensive in central Barcelona, but the hotel had a special deal with the nearby underground parking garage with the entrance off Placa d’Antoni Maura for 20€/day (regular price is 45€) which was added directly to the bill (you provide them with the entrance ticket and the hotel gives you with a special exit plastic card at the end). The only catch is that I don’t think you can move the car in and out of the lot as you please, but we never felt like we needed to drive around to see Barcelona. This underground parking lot is modern, large and very safe, but I must say that it has no air circulation whatsoever (as a result, I felt like roasting alive walking away from the car). In any case, the car itself was just fine after 3 nights parked underground. Overall, we were extremely happy with these accommodations in the Gothic Quarter! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we would definitely book it again next time in Barcelona!
UR73946957	Our group rented three rooms here and because it was across from the cathedral and on a large square we were worried about the noise. It was a good experience with expert and helpful staff..The big draw for the hotel is the location...Avoid Estruch an outdoor cafe nearby. I found a rock in my salad and dirt on the mushrooms and was met with sneers.It was the worst food of the trip. I learned the lesson that the best location can get away with the worst food.
UR72784221	We stayed here for four nights and had never been to Barcelona before. We had a most enjoyable stay and would definitely want to stay here again if we ever return to Barcelona. Location is the best aspect of the hotel -- it is directly across from the cathedral and surrounded by the Gothic quarter. It's also in easy walking distance from at least 3 stations. Just about everything you would want is nearby including several major tourist sites and some great restaurants. The hotel is u-shaped with only rooms on the outer side of one leg facing the cathedral. You have to pay a premium to get the cathedral view -- only about 1/6 of the rooms have it. The hotel restaurant seemed to be quite busy in the evening while we were there and they have outdoor tables on the view side. We were quite happy with our side street view. Service was very good. There was always at least one person at the front desk while we were coming and going -- often 3 people. They were happy with English and the Italian and German guests also seemed to be accomodated easily. Check in was almost instantaneous and checkout was similarly quick and easy. We were pleasantly surprised to return from dinner one night and found that there had been a turn down service -- this appeared to happen only if you were out in the early evening (5:30). We got a rate that included breakfast and so had breakfast there each day. It was not a heavy, cooked buffet, (although there were eggs and bacon) but we enjoyed it very much, particularly the fresh squeezed orange juice, and I found the surroundings there quite pleasant. It was a wonderful start to the day and they serve from 7 until 11. I would describe the hotel as "updated old fashioned" -- the decor and the beds are what one might have seen many years ago. It isn't the kind of hotel to have a fitness center or a pool. Hotel keys have some kind of eletronic end, but are of the type you must leave when you leave the hotel. There was also, though, free internet and plasma screen tvs. I enjoyed the ambiance -- I thought it added to my enjoyment of my trip to Barcelona -- and wasn't looking for W hotel minimalist ultra modern decor. We had a king bed that was really two small beds put together -- this was fine for us.
UR72735468	I booked far enough in advance to get a room with a terrace, complete with table and chairs and incredible views of the cathedral. This is a comfortable, beautiful historical hotel with an amazing location. The front desk staff were welcoming and friendly. The room was clean, with a decent size, however the mattress on the bed could have been a bit more comfortable. The terrace was the highlight and I highly recommend one of these rooms.
UR72575587	We are a family of nine with a mixture of ages who finished a cruise in Barcelona. We stayed three nights after the cruise to enjoy the city. First of all, finding a hotel in Barcelona that would sleep 4 was a challenge in inself. Secondly, finding a hotel with reasonable rates is problem two. Then, finding a hotel with adequate A/C is a must (as we live in Florida). Well, this was the trifecta. BTW, the location was outstanding across the square from the Gothic Cathedral, across the square from a Tourista Bus stop, and just a few minutes from La Rambla. The hotel comes across as aged fancy. There is wear and tear, but it still strives to be upscale (and succeeds, for the most part). I would strongly recommend the place. The only warning I'll give is that some of the front desk folks seem to like you better if you speak Spanish!
UR72331042	Friendly helpful staff, reasonably priced restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, excellent breakfast buffet, clean rooms, free wireless, and an unbeatable location in the gothic quarter, one block from the Jaume metro station. Easy access to the waterfront, old town, Las Ramblas, and via the metro to all parts of the city. I have stayed here three times and find it much preferable to the big expensive chain hotels.
UR70608968	Got an excellent last minute deal through Travel Republic for a four day stay in this hotel. I would recommend to a friend, as the room was very tidy, the service pleaseant and efficient and the location fantastico (you are literally facing the Cathedral, 30 secs from the nearest tube, and a couple of minutes pleasant stroll from the supercool Borne area and surrounding trendiness). Must say that the decor rather dated and the 'Courtyard view' is, well more of a 'emergency staircase view'. All in all pretty good, but I would have been annoyed to pay the rack rate for this room.
UR67715538	Everything about this hotel met and or exceeded my expectations as well as my best friend's! The hotel is conveniently located in the center of Barri Gotic and near multiple metro lines, in spitting distance to the Catedral de Barcelona (La Seu Cathedral), and moments away from the busy touristy hub of Las Ramblas! If you are taking the train into Barcelona the hotel is extremely close and the cab fare from the hotel to the Barcelona Airport was extremely reasonable and not all that far. The rooms were very large, we stayed in a triple room that had two double beds and a rollaway cot that we asked be removed since there were only two of us staying. The rooms were pleasantly decorated with floral designs and small balconies. The bathrooms were clean and well stocked with toiletries. The hotel staff were unbelievable, especially Danni! Danni made wonderful evening recommendations, to include Spanish guitar concert that was held in an intimate church in the middle of Barri Gotic, as well as a wonderful restaurant on the water for Paella. When Danni realized my friend's birthday was a mere few days from our departure to Madrid he had a bottle of champagne sent to our room to celebrate on the house! There is no question this hotel is worth staying at while visiting this gorgeous city! One of my close friends who frequents Barcelona regularly stays here every time she visits and now I can see why! If you are looking for great sites to see here are my top 5 (though there are many others I could recommend as Barcelona is incredible with so much to do and see): Picasso Museum, Park Guell, La Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila and Las Ramblas Muchas gracias Colon Hotel!
UR67494547	My husband, daughter and her boyfriend stayed in two rooms with small balconies overlooking the cathedral for seven nights. The views were terrific, rooms large and clean, good storage for thsat lenght of visit. We could walk to almost everything we wanted to see from the beach to the Sagrada Familia. We were close to many good restaurants and the hotel staff was most helpful. We would all stay there again..
UR67085463	We had a cathedral view superior room. Could walk to almost everything. The Corpus Christi celebration (early June) took place right in front of our window! This hotel was everything you would expect of a top ranked city hotel, tho we didn't eat breakfast here (17Eu) but chose to follow Tripadviser advice and eat at their lesser hotel just in back (12 eu).
UR64980192	Stayed for 1 night in may 2010, and was great hotel. We were at the hotel at 9am after leaving a cruise - no problem, our room was ready for us - was a great room, plenty of space, everything the hotel says. Would recommend to anyone. Great location as well, they were very happy to look after out luggage after we checked out. Very safe. Staff very friendly and attentive.
UR64937411	I stayed here for 2 nights in early May. I had a courtyard (non-Cathedral facing) room. It was exceptionally quiet, as were the hallways in general. The hotel is graciously old. The bathroom could have used updating - in particular the shower + tub which was in a somewhat difficult location. But this is my only criticism of this hotel. The location cannot be beat. It is only two short blocks from Las Ramblas, without the endless noise of Las Ramblas. I did not eat in the hotel's dining room, but did enjoy coffee at the outdoor dining area just outside the hotel.
UR64272378	I read a lot of reviews before finally deciding on the Hotel Colon, it was ideal for walking to the Ramblas and Catalunya square.. Did breakfast the first morning E18 each, if you like a good English breakfast forget it, we never bothered again, found a nice cafe serving coffee and a bun for E1.75 round the corner from the hotel which suited us fine The bed linen was changed every day as was the towels, the cleaner, a nice lady gave us extra pillows the 2nd mornng as the pillows were terrible. The room was clean but hardly ever hoovered, it wasn't hoovered the day we arrived, never bothered to complain as I read the staff never went out of their way to sort things out, which I must agree with as I had to ask them about a few things and just got a basic answer. We were on the 5th floor and slept well, never heard any noise from the square below, or from any other rooms. Would use the hotel again though, as the location was spot on.
UR64243568	We were most satisfied with our four day stay at the Hotel Colon in early May 2010. The room was attractive and the cleanliness of the facility was top notch. We were pleased to have --finally-- chosen to stay in the Barri Gotic rather than the Eixample. The excellent subway allows visitors to move around with expedience, but we found more reasons to move in our direction rather than to the Eixample. The Jaume I subway is just a few blocks away and the Born/ Ribera area is an easy walk, even for oldies like us. The rooms fronting on the Cathedral plaza give a feeling of "happening" at the cost of a little noise if the French doors are left opening. No problem. One point that should be stressed is that the public rooms of this hotel are very attractive and comfortable. Off the main lobby on one side are an attractive and comfortable restaurant and bar/lounge; on the other side is a club-like reading room. Very much old-school Europe. Go there!
UR62888854	This was our 3rd visit to the Hotel Colon and once again we were not disappointed with our accommodation & general ambiance of this Hotel. My partner, our 15 years old daughter & I booked into the hotel for a 4 day break & ended up staying for 11 days! Yes, you've guessed it - we were 3 of the many 'victims' of closed airspace due to that unprouncable volcano spewing ash from Iceland. I have to say that the hotel staff were absolutely brilliant in ensuring that we could still be accommodated during the crisis. In particular, Letitia (receptionist) was lovely and extremely helpful, sympathetic & caring. We were also told by the reception staff that if we could not be accommodated by the hotel as our forced stay continued, they would find another hotel for us - this helped to take the pressure of the situation off us a little bit. As always, at this hotel our room was very spacious, spotlessly clean and had everything we needed. We were booked on a room only basis so had breakfeast at the local Tapas bars. We had evening meals at a different restaurant each night - there are lots to choose from. Room service at Hotel Colon is excellent, efficient & friendly. Finally, we cannot praise the staff at Hotel Colon enough - thank you Letitia - enjoy the flowers!
UR62764912	Stayed @ hotel Colon for 5 nights. Great location,most sights were walkable & many restaurants & tapas nearby . The hotel staff was friendly & helpful. Our first night in our room was noisy and when we asked for another room, we were upgraded to a terrace room @ no additional charge, Breakfast was good-glad we chose to include it. Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel.
UR61863259	The hotel is in a very good location, right across from the Cathedral, in the heart of the Barrio Gotica, 5 minutes walk from one metro stop and 8 minutes from another. The desk staff was brisk but efficient. The only knock is that the bidet is located only 6" from the front of the toilet, leading to some potentially uncomfortable situations.
UR61836420	I stayed in this hotel one night and enjoyed the location. The location is very central to many things like the outdoor market, churches, tour buses, etc. The room itself was basic but clean and large. The staff were nice.
UR55298048	For a first time visitor to Barcelona, and in fact Spain as I've simply never have any inclination to go there before, this hotel is excellently located. On a sqaure with the city's gothic cathedral on one side, a taxi rank and bus stop for the city's official hop on and off tour on another and a five minute walk from the other side to Las Ramblas which can then lead you up to a main shopping and Gaudi laden strip or down to the Port. It means that without a lot of effort you can hit a lot of the major tourist destinations in a very short period of time, the offiical bus tourista is an excellent way to see all the sights even of you don't plan to visit them all and the hop on and off aspect of it mean you don't need to worry about being stranded in the middle of nowhere. The service in the hotel was very good, they all spoke excellent english which made up for my severe lack of Spanish language skills and were very helpful when asked for directions/advice. The only downside I found was that my room backed onto a local bar and could be a little noisy at time though nothing to write home about, also the wifi access that had made me pick this hotel over another was dramatically overrated, it is only available in the lobby and was clunky and slow. My room was clean but felt a little dated with flowery upholstery on every surface, a single long pillow on a double bed made me grateful I was travelling alone though as i was able to fold it over. All in all a good choice for a city break if you want to cram as much in as possible in a short space of time.
UR54551940	This hotel offered comfortable and clean rooms and a good breakfast. The staff are friendly and efficient, but for the few who hang around during breakfast. Although it is far enough from the Ramblas to be quiet, we were there during the Merce festival and there was a huge music stage rigged up in front of the hotel - the music might have been good but was amplified to distortion and continued late into the night. Are room faced to the back, but even so the noise was extremely irritating. However we may return to the hotel in future and know to avoid the festival period (around the Barcelona public holiday 24 September)
UR51225855	We stayed for 3 nights before a cruise out of Barcelona. Well worth upgrading to this hotel. We checked in on Friday had a fabulous room (not with a balcony) there was a smell of paint on the floor. The hotel was full they did change the room to a slightly smaller room with a balcony you can stand on and a view of the Cathedral and square. All the staff were amazing and very helpful. The breakfast was very good and included in our rate from Travel Republic. I was concerned about the noise from a room facing the cathedral but we couldn't hear a thing when the windows were closed and curtains drawn. The location is outstanding - walking distance to many attractions, close to the metro and buses. Barcelona is very easy to navigate. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
UR51123632	We went to Barcelona for a weekend break and so wanted an attractive hotel in a central situation, convenient to the main attractions. Hotel Colon fitted our requirements perfectly, being right opposite the Gothic Cathedral, not to be confused with the Sagrada Familia. It is comfortable and the staff were very couteous and helpful. Our room was not one of the front facing ones, but was spacious and well appointed. The excellent breakfast was included in the price of the room. It is within 5 to 10 minutes walk of Place Catalunya, the main hub of Barcelona and the destination of the Airport buses, and the Ramblas. Opposite the hotel and next to the Cathedral is a little advertised museum, which I think is run by the Cathedral. On the top floor it has an amaxing exhibition dedicted to an uncompleted church by Gaudi complete with first rate models and texts. A must for anyone interested in his work.
UR50375648	We booked a room through Expedia.com at the Regencia Colon, which is right next door (although not on the Plaza) to the Hotel Colon. At check-in they bumped us to the Hotel Colon. We had seen other reviewers with the same experience, so it wasn't a complete surprise. And since the Colon is more expensive we were fine with the move. They even had the bell hop walk our luggage around the corner for us. The Hotel Colon is an average European hotel in a great location. The room was a bit dated in facilities and decor and the bed is definately FIRM. But the staff was friendly and you can walk to most of the sights or take the nearby Metro to the others. I saw some comments about it being noisy, but we were there on a Saturday night and slept with our window open all night and only heard the clock bells (although our room was not facing the Plaza.) TIP: If you are coming from the airport, take the Aerobus for 5 euros to the Plaza Catalunya and then walk from there. It's 2-3 blocks down a pedestrian only street and we (two middle aged women) felt very safe with our rolling luggage walking to the hotel. It was daytime, but I would do it in the early evening, too. Maybe just not late night.
UR50370268	We had a bad experience in Barcelona. We left a backpack with valuables in our car in the garage next to the hotel, not obviously, but hidden. Nevertheless, the lock to the car was picked open and the backpack neatly removed. Luckily, a GPS (probably because it was in a dark black bag that couldn't be seen) was left behind. Not the hotel's fault at all - they don't own the garage, but they could have been a bit more helpful when we were in a panic. We had already left Barcelona so we frantically tried to contact them. They did a rudimentary check, but they didn't take the initiative to follow up or respond to my email. Anyone renting a car in Europe - be warned now. Cars don't have alarms (you think you are beeping with the key to open and lock, but it's not an alarm.) You are also liable for charges if the car was damaged as ours was, so get insurance when you rent. I think the hotel should have warned us about the garage when they gave us that option for parking, and should have done a little more work with the parking garage to help find it. Another negative about the location - early in the morning on our first day there, I saw something like a gang fight on the street below our balcony. Thugs in black were shouting and fighting. In fact, they had a backpack, and now I'm wondering if it was mine. Luckily, when they left there was no blood (or body) on the ground. Now to the good part. The hotel deserves a better rating than it does. The room we had was gorgeous, a spacious triple with beautiful decor. The bathroom was very elegant and clean even if the toilet was a little too close to the open bathtub and water splashed all over because of an inadequate screen (we saw this in other hotels in France also). The staff was very helpful, helping us with the Wifi in the room (which worked great), giving us info about restaurants or responding to any housekeeping requests. They were quick to help with the luggage - a really thoughtful touch. The location was perfect, in the heart of the City, in front of the Cathedral and a subway ride away from major attractions. Innumerable shops and restaurants are close by and La Rambla is within walking distance from the hotel. Barcelona is a hopping place with people in the streets late into the night and innumerable sights to see – the Museu Naciounal D'Art De Catalunya (The National Art Museum of Catalonia), Gaudi art and architecture at the Sagrada Familia church and the Park Guell and the waterfront with its statue of Columbus. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was sumptuous, but the restaurant didn't work out for us for other meals because we are vegetarians. With its alternative culture, Barcelona is great for vegetarians though, and we hit a number of pure veggie restaurants. Best one: Sesamo with a delicious pumpkin soup and pumpkin pie. Bottom Line: Barcelona has all the high-thumping energy of a big city, but also the downside (we found blood-soaked paper towels in a subway station). Hotel Colon is a great bargain (of course, we went in the low season), but be careful. Don’t go for a walk alone at 6.30 am (12 am, ironically, is probably OK) and don’t leave your car in the garage next to the hotel.
UR50238862	First room had a view of an air vent with pipes running up and down. Our request to change was met with indifference, not a good start, but for a fair increase in our room rate we were able to move to a room overlooking the plaza and the Cathedral. The new room alone made our stay at the hotel worth it, but of all the hotels we stayed at on this trip the staff was the least helpful and accomodating. Seemed to be more interested in talking among themselves behind the desk than providing useful information. Nevertheless, the room was clean and the hotel was well maintained and, certainly, well located. Also, if you happen to need it, terrible wireless, none in the room.
UR48943867	Located right across from the Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter, this hotel provided a great home base for sighseeing. We walked to all of the main attractions. However, there are also a few metro stops close by. We had an interior room which was extremely quiet. The rooms were relatively large and clean. I would definitely stay here again.
UR47395554	Perfect location for walking, dining, sightseeing, people watching Excellent Staff Not luxuorious Gaudi Cathedral across plaza - can see from balcony Salvadore Dali museum 1/2 block away, double decker bus stop across the street, all the shops, Los Ramblas, open air markets, 2 minute walk
UR46868745	Location great! Walking distance to many sights. Get lost in the Gothic quarter and still find your hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Quite clean. Staff very responsive for one small plumbing issue that we had. The last week of September is the Merce holiday for 5 days. Don't ask for a room looking out on the plaza. The music concert from 10pm-2am is loud. Wi-fi was okay, but spotty. Overall, very good and helped to make our Barcelona stay wonderful.
UR46212016	In the heart of the interesting Bari Gotic neighborhood, this landmark hotel is just a few minutes' walk from Las Ramblas and other wonderful sites. There's a lot of history attached to the Colon -- it was the place to stay for celebrities of all types in the '50's and '60's. Although the rooms' decor could use an update, they are spacious and comfortable, and include all the amenities. Desk and bell staff are gracious and helpful. The restaurant and bar are beautiful! (Can't comment on the food because we didn't eat there.) We got a very reasonable rate for our 3-night stay (didn't opt for the breakfast since the price was a bit high). We have recommended this hotel to several friends without hesitation!
UR46209889	This hotel has great service and amazing views from the balcony. We had a room facing the cathedral, Waking up to such a view was magnificent. The food was delicious and the reception was very helpful. We definetly recommend it. It is also right in the center of all the attractions and a few blocks away from the Ramblas. We had a Very fun trip!
UR45689713	We recently stayed at the Hotel Colon on our first trip to Barcelona. We loved the location- right across from the cathedral and an easy walk to many major attractions. The hotel is first rate; the desk staff was right there whenever we needed them, our room was a good size, beds comfortable, the bathroom very good and clean. breakfast was good (not great) and plentiful with an excellent staff keeping the buffet full and the tables clean. There is a restaurant, which we did not use at all, but we appreciated having a bar for a night cap. Our room was always clean and made-up in a timely manner. We enjoyed the hotel and would definitely stay here again
UR40410257	Fantastic location, service was very good, rooms were big, clean & had all that was needed. Right in the middle of the old gothic area & there were things to do around the clock. I picked this place on a whim and was totally satisfied. Would highly recommend.
UR38345809	Arrived at Regencia Colon as booked, but had been moved to main hotel. Great location directly opposite Cathedral and in walking distance of all attractions, or a metro station. This square was a hive of activity most evenings, partcularly for the festive of San Roc. Didn't breakfast at hotel, due to cost, but choose nearby cafes instead - all three of us ate for price of one at hotel. Desk staff spoke perfect English and were very helpful. Room was for three, being a twin with a temporary bed - but adequate size. Aircon great: efficient and not noisy. Balcony was pleasant although view was only of the other hotel.
UR37021794	My wife and I spent 10 days at this beautiful hotel. I originally booked it because of the location (right off La Rambla) and price, but when we arrived we were also very impressed by the immaculate conditions and the room location (with balcony). We were also very impressed with the friendly and helpful staff. We travel frequently and we could not say that we have ever had a better experience with this kind group of dedicated people! Very highly recommended!
UR35081510	The main entrance to the place is pretty and classically luxurious. We were greeted by a gentleman who was from Seattle - so communicating was not a problem. When arriving to our room, we were disappointed by having 2 double beds, not a queen or matrimonial, like we thought we had booked. We had the porter ask to change us, but they did not have a room available. We never heard back regarding a change... and to be honest - the room was big and comfortable otherwise, so we didn't mind. We did not have a view, which was a bit disappointing because the hotel is located on the Placa de Catedral, overlooking one of the most famous Cathedrals in all of Barcelona. Although, we considered that it was probably really loud on that side of the building, and our side was great for siesta (which you must do since dinner doesn't start there until 9pm at least)! Dont be fooled by the free internet that is posted on expedias website. Internet is 9 euro for 24 hrs. There was a restaurant in the hotel that was always bumping. We chose to eat elsewhere. We used the Fodor's travel book, which was excellent for suggestions for traveling the city and restaurant choices (just don't go to Limbo - my husband got sick after eating there, although my food was fine).
UR35068939	The Good: Location - close to station, in the Gothic Quarter. Room nice, but decor & wallpaper too flowery for me. Mini-bar, bathtub, safe. 24hr reception. Friendly staff who actually do seem to give a s***. The Bad: Failed the primary criteria of a good nights sleep. Wi fi is only on the lobby level, and 10e/day at that. Unbelievable. Also the nightclub outside my side of the building, although that stopped by midnight (sat night). 90e for single use, double bed. No extra pillow - pretty poor for 4**** Worst bit though was not getting a good night's sleep. The room had a widescreen monitor/LCD which was controlled by a PC somewhere in the backend. You control it with a remote, and can choose between options like info about the city, TV, etc. Turned it off before i went to bed coz it lit the room like a floodlight.. the backend PC rebooted twice during the middle of the night, turning the screen back on and waking me up & forcing me to find the remote to turn it back off. You can't turn it off on the screen either coz they've turned the kid lock on. If you ignore me and stay here, see if you can yank the power out before you go to bed.
UR35018725	Not a place you want to hang out in your room, especially if you are solo traveller. Single rooms are small, window facing narrow service yard, next to maid's closet. You feel like Harry Potter living under the stairs. Double rooms are more spacious and have small balconies with wooden shutters. But overall the rooms are shabby, stained carpets and thin sheets. Full bathrooms are clean and big enough. Staff is friendly, but not very efficient- took 15 minutes to check in and then they gave me the wrong key. There is always chaos around the front desk. HOWEVER, this is very excellent location and the hotel does have some charm, with small sidewalk cafe service right on the cathedral square. I would look for other hotel within a few blocks of this for more comfortable rooms. They claim wifi, but it is only the lobby, and costs 10 euro per day. TV internet in rooms, same price.
UR33454240	Hotel Colon was a fantastic hotel – the location, service, and reasonable price. The location is truly unbeatable, right on the plaza of the Cathedral where there are markets, musicians, and walking distance from so many tourist attractions. The staff spoke English and was very professional yet maintained a sense of humor. They recommended and helped book tickets to a flamenco show, gave us honest recommendations on sites (including those that weren’t listed in our guide book), and helped us make the most of our short stay in Barcelona. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else!
UR31816796	Location was great, walking distance to LaRambla St. The metro is just a few blocks away and the double deck tour bus stops right outside the hotel. Rooms were ok, nothing special for the $ paid, but you are paying for the location.
UR31630726	We stayed 3 days at Hotel Colon during our honeymoon in Europe. We were pleasantly greeeted upon our arrival, and happily informed that our room had been upgraded (which was especially great coming from a very small room in Paris). Staff was very helpful getting us around Barcelona to see the sights. We did order room service one morning for breakfast - we would pass next time. Location was perfect.
UR31268052	The hotel is very close to Catalunya Square, where the airport bus drops you off. The hotel is in a lovely part of Barcelona, there is plenty to do, restaurants, sight see, shop or go to the beach. I asked for an iron and ironing board and the hotel was very quick at bringing one. I picked this hotel on some of the other reviews I'd read and as I was travelling alone wanted somewhere central. I was not disappointed. I booked room only, you can get coffee and croissants for 1 euro 50 in local cafes. If taking the bus tour I would advise you not to get on the stop at Catalunya Square, as the waiting time in the queue was 1 hour. Pick the bus up at the stop the other side of the square.
UR31012998	Before leaving for our 12 day mediterranean cruise out of Barcelona, we came a day early and stayed at this wonderful hotel. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours out of the states so by the time we reached the hotel we were hot, tired and disgrunted. We were met by the pleasant staff who informed us we had a very nice room waiting for us. That was an understatement! The place was HUGE by European standards and we had the most awesome balcony that could fit about 20 people on it overlooking the Cathedral! It was wonderful and within walking distance of Las Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter and many other places of interest. Definitely request the Cathedral view, it is well worth it!
UR30577359	This hotel is in a great location, opposite the Cathedral. It's a bit pricey but worth it for a special trip. We booked a regular double room and were upgraded to an executive room with a view across the Cathedral square. It was beautifully decorated, two little armchairs by the window with a mini balcony, big bedroom and a smaller hallway with the bathroom off that. Bathroom was big, very warm and apart from a couple of ants who came to visit very clean. The TV was very flash. We spent an hour one morning wrestling with the many controls which had locked itself before asking reception for help. Breakfast is expensive so we went elsewhere mostly though ordered to the room one morning. Continental spread is good and filling. Staff are helpful though I wouldn't go as far as friendly. But you really can't beat the location. Easy to get everywhere, loads of little bars and cafes nearby and on a Sunday morning you're in a prime position to watch the traditional dancing outside the Cathedral.
UR30476933	My wife and I just returned from a 9 night stay at Hotel Colon. The staff speaks English and is polite and responsive to requests. The location on the large plaza of the Cathedral is excellent. The first room we were assigned was adjacent to the elevator and we asked to change. The staff was most willing to let us choose from a variety of other rooms. The back rooms are very quiet while the front rooms have a more interesting view but do have some noise associated with the plaza activity.
UR30304944	On May 7, 2009, I wanted to go see the magical fountain, Font Magica de Montjuic, for the light show to music. I asked the front desk if the show was going to be on, since I know it is off in the winter months. The front desk checked their computer and then called the Mayor's office to confirm.. They said to me, "Yes, it is on for sure." So, we took the metro and guess what - it was not on due to an international car show around the fountain that lasts from May1 - May 17 each year! What a disappointment and when I relayed this info to the front desk of the Colon Hotel, they couldn't have cared less. Also, our room was quite dirty and could use some sprucing up, but its a great location.
UR30002160	I loved the location of this hotel. Never having been in Barcelona before, and traveling alone, it was such a pleasure to find this hotel right away. Very easy to hop on a bus from airport and stop in Plaza Catalunya, from there a short walk to hotel. Just look for the Cathedral. However, it is not worth extra money to face the cathedral as the cathedral is completely under construction and covered with scaffolding. I had a nice room on the side with a partial cathedral view for less money. Also, this is a busy location and can be noisy, even though the windows are double pained. I had a small balcony which was nice. My room was large and comfortable, I splurged for a double, as I read the singles can be quite small. The bathroom was also quite spacious. My few complaints were there was a stale odor in the room that I noticed immediately upon walking in, that didn't go away even when I opened the windows. Also, everything was extra, including in house internet. The location was perfect right in Barri Gothic, so many things within walking distance.
UR27093823	This was our first time in Barcelona and my husband and I only had a two night stay, so the central location of the hotel was important. We had booked into the Regencia Colon but as the hotel was full we were transferred to its sister hotel - The Hotel Colon which was just in front. This seems to happen regularly. As it turned out we weren’t disappointed. We always look for hotels with a central location and their cleanliness is very important to us. The hotel has a fantastic location directly opposite the Cathedral and is surrounded by shops and restaurants. We were close to Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. The “tourista bus” can be caught right across the street and the metro stop is within a very short walk. Our room was at the end of a corridor at the back of the hotel. Number 203. There wasn’t much to look at but a few plants from the windows. This did not bother us as the room was quiet. It was spacious and comfortable with a lovely bathroom and it was very clean. We had a safe, a mini bar, robes and slippers, but like many European hotels no tea/coffee making facilities (but we had taken own). We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food or prices. We didn’t have much interaction with the staff, but the few we came across were pleasant and efficient. I would happily recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable stay in a lovely city.
UR24721848	stayed at the Colon Hotel for two nights recently on business in Barcelona. Check in swift, hotel clean and presentable, an older styled traditional hotel. Directly opp the cathedral opening onto a large square. The hotel room i stayed in was quiet, very clean, decent sized room, television inc sky news and CNN, no BBC! room has a mini bar, no tea/coffee facilities. Bathrooms large, beds comfortable! so able to get a good nights sleep. Barcelona itself was busy...didn't explore much although would return for a weekend etc... only down side items were: plumbing issues on 6th floor + no wi-fi in room only lounge... apart from that a decent hotel, staff also smile! rare in some parts these days!
UR24699315	Our nightmare begins.... My comment is for Hotel Colon because I was unexpectedly moved to this sister hotel without notification. I had booked 1.5 months in advance [ Hotel Regencia Colon] only to arrive and discover that my booking was useless and that the hotel was 'full'. I was sent to Hotel Colon instead (which was next door) and had one of the WORSE experiences ever. For the first night, we were given a room on the 2nd floor with a balcony facing a side street. The walls were thin as paper and the street noise filled the room thoughout the night. The room was literally a 'sauna' and could not be adjusted. Due to saftely concerns, we could not open the balcony door so we had to endure the heat for the entire night. Upon returning to the hotel for our remaining two nights (at the end of our cruise) we again encountered more difficulties. The DAY STAFF were RUDE and treated us as second-rate customers. The two gentlemen (not deserving of such a title) absolutely ignored me when I attempted to check-in and only looked up disdainfully when I said "excuse me". It was obvious that they did not wish to serve me atall, and provided as little service as possible. I had inquired as to why our bookings were useless and was promptly answered with a single reply: "hotel is full". When I requested a room on a higher floor noting that our last room was quite noisy as it was on a lower level, the gentleman answered: "Depends if there is room" I was not asking for a room with a view....just one that was on a higher floor. Strangely though, the British couple in front of me were treated quite nicely and upgraded to a higher floor with a view facing the Cathedral. If there were no rooms, than why were the couple upgraded? After a few moments, he advises me that he has "upgraded" me to a room on the 4th floor. It certainly was an upgrade.....a room where renovations were occuring. One or two rooms were being painted at the time and the smell of paint permeated the entire floor, even our room which was 3 doors away. After staying in our room for 45 minutes, I decided to request a room change because my family and I all experienced headaches and nausea. Luckily, the NIGHT crew were professional and accomodating so we were able to change rooms. At this point I was advised that there were many empty rooms. If so, why was I given a room on a floor that was undergoing renovations? Further interactions with the DAY staff were quite unpleasant. Everytime I went to the front desk, I was ignored. I was not greeted at all except with a disdainful look everytime I said "excuse me". It was as if I were trying to "pull teeth"!! This perplexed me...I could not understand why I was treated in such a manner. I spoke fluent english and was polite. Why? I suspect the reason for such sub-standard service and chilly reception was due to the fact that I was Asian. There was just no other explanation. I did notice that other non-Asian guests were treated with welcoming "hellos" and "I hope you enjoy your stay", while myself and other Japanese guests were welcomed with blank stares. Having grown up in Canada, I was quite unaccustomed to such treatment as race/heritage is never an issue in our country. I hope this is a one-time occurence and not the norm at this hotel. It should be noted that the DAY staff were rude and NOT the NIGHT staff. The night staff were professional and the bell hop was exceptionally kind. Credit should be given where credit is due. This hotel deserves a poor rating only because of the horrible service (Day Staff). I will certainly never return to this hotel.
UR24558258	My husband & I stayed in Colon for 6 days and we're really glad we stayed there. The staff have been very helpful and attentive from day 1 up to the time we left. The location is just by the Cathedral and we're lucky enough to see the Monte Carlo Rally that started from Barcelona and we watched it right from the balcony of our hotel room. There are restaurants around. La Rambla, Plaza Catalunya, and even the Marina are all within short walking distance. GREAT central location! And service is very satisfactory. If we go back to Barcelona, we will definitely stay in this hotel again.
UR24437485	We actually booked to stay at this hotel's "poorer cousin" the Hotel Regencia which is metres away but were actually transferred to this hotel at no extra cost - I'm still not sure why! This hotel was fantastic - not modern but very traditional and has a bit of class and history about it. We caught the Aerobus (only 4.20 euro) from the airport to Placa Catalunya (where it terminates) which is about a 15 minute ride. Placa Catalunya is an easy 10 minute walk on a wide pedestrianised street to the hotel. The location is perfect - directly opposite the Barcelona Cathedral in the old town. La Rambla is a 5 minute walk away. The waterfront is a good 20 minute walk. There are plenty of shops and eateries around the Cathedral. The Museu Picasso is also nearby. The stop for the Hop on Hop off bus tour is also at the Placa Catalunya bus stop. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We didn't try the restaurant though. Overall a very enjoyable stay. Has made me think again about sticking with chain hotels (we usually stay with Ibis and Mercure hotels) but this hotel was a lot classier, had an excellent rate and fantastic location to boot.
UR23729945	This hotel is located within walking distance of Las Ramblas, yet far enough away from all the hustle and bustle. It's located in the beautiful Placa Cathedral, opposite the Cathedral of Barcelona and the Gaudi museum. There were three of us sharing a room; a standard twin room with a folding guest bed (which was very comfortable). The room was of a decent size and admittedly the decor was a little tired, however, the rooms are clean with the usual amenities. The buffet breakfast offered a large selection of food to suit all. We were all happy with the variety on offer! The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful. No complaints from us whatsover!
UR23697020	We've just stayed at the Colon for 4 nights and have seen an improvement since our last stay in 2006 Location is perfect, staff are very helpful and friendly Cathedral is currently covered in scaffolding but a room with a Cathedral room is still great Watch out if you leave tips on the outside tables, beggars walk off with them but that was the only fault!
UR23561544	This hotel is a bargain! Great value for money, and great location. By bus it's easy to find it from the airport. The airport shutle bus departs every 6. minute and costs about 6 eur. After 20 minutes get of at Placa de Catalunya. Turne around and walk down the Avinguda del Portal de l'Angel. After a five minute walk, turne slightly to the left and walk Carrer dels Arcs for about 100 meters. You will then see the cathedral and the open square in front of you. Hotel Colon is on your left hand side about fifty meters from the opening of the square. All in all a nice, short walk from the bus stop. I paid about 65 eur. for a single room. The room was surprisingly big. It had a flat screen with DVD and a comfy bed. The style of the room was not very modern, but very cosy. The room should be refurbished. There are some paint falling of at he bathroom walls, and a crack here and there. Do not expect perfection! However; compared to other single rooms I have had in other european cities (like Paris e.g), this hotel offers a lot more for your money! And the location is perfect - right in the midle of everything! The staff is professional and polite. Very good service! In this price category, I would surely stay at the Hotel Colon when going to Barcelona in the future!
UR22918633	2 x interconnecting rooms for family. Good rooms with all that you will need, wife liked bathroom and accessories/robes/etc etc. rooms overlooking street at back of property, suggest higher room best to avoid any noise, we were 3rd floor and no problem. The best thing is just step out the door and you are in the old city and for a short stay that is invaluable, the Ramblas is 3 mins walk away. The hotel bar is great for a nightcap with piano player setting the mood. Staff top class and friendly, all in all great for a short stay and to feel the real Barca.
UR22879359	Six of us stayed at the Colon Hotel before leaving on a cruise. We all had different types of rooms - ours had 2 small balconies and faced the cathedral. It was quite a large room with a nice seating area and huge closet. The hotel staff was very friendly. The location of the hotel is perfect - there are plenty of restaurants nearby and it is only a short walk to Las Ramblas. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.
UR22439598	we were only able to spend one night at this wonderful hotel, in the very center of the city, across from the cathedral. las ramblas was a short distance away.. unfortunately, the weather wasn't too agreeable rainy and cold, but we still ventured out and enjoyed as much as we could. our room 609 was incredible, a huge terrace with white columns surrounded the whole room with a wonderful view of the cathedral, which is still being renovated, so it is covered by scaffolding, etc... i would recommend this hotel to everyone.
UR22393803	We stayed at the Colon in Barcelona at the end of our Mediterranean cruise. Our first impression upon checking in was not great. They were very busy and we waited for about ten minutes before we were acknowledged. We got a great price on the room for two nights, $240 EU inclusive of VAT. The room was OK, carpet a little worn, but everything else was great. New flat screen TV, beds that were not hard as a rock (atypical for Europe in our experience) and the service was outstanding. We had a couple of problems with the room and someone was at our door to correct things within 5 minutes of calling the front desk. The location is fantastic - it is directly across the street from the Barcelona Cathedral and within walking distance of Las Rambles and other sights. The food in the hotel's restaurant is excellent -a fixed price 3 course meal including wine and bottled water was 22 EU and the Catalonian cuisine was excellent. The front desk people were very helpful and referred us to a private 1/2 day tour that was perfect. All together it was a very good experience and we'd stay there again
UR22295750	We stayed 4 nights at the Colon before leaving Barcelona on a cruise. The location is great--right across the plaza from the Cathedral. We received a free upgrade to a superior room which was very large and had a wonderful view of the facade of the Cathedral, which unfortunately is currently covered with scaffolding for renovations. It's just a short walk from the hotel to the Metro, and the staff was most helpful in giving directions and suggesting places to eat, etc. It's great to travel off-season--no crowds or lines. San Rafael, CA
UR21453781	We loved our short stay at Hotel Colon. We stayed for one night in the beginning of December. The area outside was set up with a big Christmas festival. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very clean, large, and comfortable. I would highly recommend Hotel Colon to anyone visiting Barcelona.
UR21282781	I cant imagine why this hotel isn't in the top 10 places to stay in Barcelona. Its location is completely perfect, facing the cathedral with morning sunshine on the little balconies. The staff are genuinely helpful and eager to please, and if it is old fashioned, it is in the best sense of the phrase. This is the second time I've been there and although people rave about boutique hotels tucked down alleyways they can be rather poky and dark. This is a proper Barcelona gem, full of light and charm.
UR21181987	just ret'd from a most enjoyable stay at the colon hotel. the location is perfect....the staff is extremely helpful and our average-priced room was very comfortable. i would recommend to any and all.
UR20036843	I agree with other reviewers on this page that if you want somewhere right in the centre of Barcelona, then this hotel makes a great base for vacationing in the city. However, I was there on business. If you're planning to stay here and need such things as full internet facilities in the room, a desk to work from in the room, efficient room service, a restaurant as opposed to a cafe, air conditioning which cools below 25 degrees centigrade, your messages taken and passed on promptly - and courteous staff, then you might want to take a look at what else is available in the area.
UR20008273	This hotel is located next to the cathedral and in a wonderful old area for walking and shopping. We were treated to a large second floor room facing the cathedral although we had not requested this. The staff was very efficient and helpful. The only slight problem we had was not with the hotel but with our taxi ride to the cruise port. It would have been helpful if we had known the terminal number to aid the driver.
UR19904700	I loved to stay there it's a very nice and friendly hotel, service is great and also the food and cleaning service is perfect. Walking to the La Rambla takes like 5 minutes. The Picasso museum is also in 10 minutes walking distance. Just perfect .
UR19049887	We stayed at this hotel in July/08. It is right on the Plaza in front of the grand Cathedral. What a beautiful cathedral ! We loved the balcony room overlooking the church. When they complete the exterior refurbishment of the cathedral and take down the scaffolding, these rooms will be great. 2 blocks from the Metro, and 6 blocks from the middlle of La Rambla. 1 mile or so from the water. Hotel is old but comfortable and old world. Loved it. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby. One concern-loud teenagers hanging out late in the plaza can make it hard to sleep if you want the windows open for the cool breezes. Rooms are small but typical. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Nice outdoor restaurants nearby. Grocery store within 4 blocks. Banks within a block. Felt very safe in this old area of the city. One caution- Be careful in subways. My brother had his wallet stolen from his front pocket. Lots of pickpockets hovering near ticket machines and entrances of metro, and they are very good.. Barcelona is fantastic.
UR18433214	This was our second trip to Barcelona and we tried to stay here previously, but it was full. We are glad we gave it a second chance. Went with our daughter and son-in-law; who arrived before we did. They had a nice chat with the front desk and had us moved from a back room to a room facing the plaza/cathedral. The staff also sent them a bottle of bubbly to help them enjoy their stay. This was a nice touch. There can be some noise in the plaza, but the back rooms are not necessarily quieter. Hotel has a nice lobby and a good location. The rooms are typically small, but fine for sleeping. The bathroom area was OK with no difficulties.We did not have any meals at the hotel, but found nice spots for breakfast nearby and good dining in the area.
UR17982703	Conveniently located right across from the Cathedral, the Hotel Colon provides comfortable accomadations, albeit simple. The Hotel has a fantastic location as it literally sits on the plaza where the Cathedral is located, and is only a 5-7 minute walk to La Rambla (one of the main walking streets in Barcelona) and the Catalunya Metro stop. The hotel staff were all quite friendly and spoke decent english, which is more than i can say for the folks at the renfe train stations! The room is clean, but its bare (bed, small desk, TV), however you won't be in the room other than to sleep. Their is a flat screen, however doesn't work that well, also their is an in-room safe. AC however was a plus as it was quite hot during my stay. Bathroom was also clean. The hotel does have bar/restaurant, however breakfast was quite expensive (I recall approximately 17 euro), and I only ate their once due to that. You can find many places along La Rambla that offer simple coffee and pastries (try the fish market off La Rambla!!..several coffee bars while you watch the vendors setup in the morning was awesome!!). You can have a drink outside, which is nice while people watching. I'd say this is a good choice economically, however if you are looking for anything else besides clean and simple, check elsewhere.
UR16324676	This is a very good choice in Barcelona. It is just a couple blocks off La Rambla and is right across the street from the Catradal. The rooms are small but quiet and comfortable. The Service was perfect. Take time to wander the streets in the evening, this place doesn't start to come alive until around 8PM. The Breakfast is small but good and overpriced.
UR16086783	We had a reservation at the sister hotel Regencia Colon, but when we arrived on May 1, the Regencia said they had overbooked and were transferring us to the "four star" Colon. Unfortunately, the Colon is not up to par. The rooms were hot and the air conditioning hadn't yet been turned on for the summer. Moreover, the bedspread, carpeting, and furniture upholstery were stained and unappealing. The bed was low and lumpy. The bathroom was old with the sort of grime around the edges that is from old age not from lack of trying to clean. We checked out, paid for one night, and looked for another hotel, evenutally staying at Le Meridien. To its credit, when we complained to Utell about our experience, Colon refunded our money. The location is charming in the old part of the city, the lobby is pleasant, but the rooms need an overhaul.
UR15603669	Well located - Cathedral opposite and Ramblas very close.
UR15483102	We stayed in Barcelona a few years ago in the Eixample district uptown. The location of the Colon was much better. You can walk everywhere except some of the Gaudi sites. Its right on a nice pedestrian i.e. quiet square across from the Cathedral. We had booked a triple and then changed to a double but they gave us the triple at the double price. it was a wonderful room. Great view, plenty of light. We had breakfast at one of the many cafes nearby. This place must have the only American bellhop in town. Good people, good value. Enjoy
UR15168845	This place has a terrific location. Six of us stayed here recently in a variety of rooms-- some single. Front desk staff is agreeable-- but not very good is suggesting restaurants. After a week-long visit and I would have no trouble in suggesting it to others. Susan Walker, Vancouver, Canada
UR14712220	I'm more of a 2-3* hotel kind of person and not used to staying at such a 4* hotel like Hotel Colon. I didn't have much choice when booking a hotel in Barcelona because this was a last-minute trip. The hotel is of the old world 4* style, rather than the modern minimalistic kind. It's more suited for older folks, IMO. Pros: The location is great, just across from the cathedral. I pretty much walked everywhere (with the exception of La Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell). The neighborhood is very safe. The single room is fairly spacious for European standard. The bed itself is almost a full-size, rather than twin bed that I usually get. There is a in-room safe, bathroom amenities include hairdryer, bathrobe and slippers. The TV is a flat panel, "smart" TV. It can be hooked up to your laptop and you can download your photos etc. But everything comes with an additional charge. Cons: The front desk guy is just grumpy. On my 2nd day I asked him to call Comerc 24 for me to confirm my dinner reservation. He was rather unwilling to do so. My room, apart from being spacious, is rather ugly. There is a obvious stain on the carpet (see my photo). The room also has a musty smell, like it hasn't been used for ages. I had to go to a candle shop to buy some scented candles in order to mask the smell. Bathroom is kind of standard, not very modern. The room faces the small street behind the hotel, and there is a Taverna right across the street. Even though the windows are thick, I can still hear noises from the diners when they exit the restaurant. On my 2nd night there, the garbage truck came around in the middle of the night and made a lot of noise for at least 5 minutes. Breakfast is an additional 15€, I think. It's way over my budget so I didn't eat there. Bottom line I think the nicer (more expensive) rooms probably live up to its reputation, but not my single room. I definitely would not stay there again; just not my cup of tea.
UR14164341	The Hotel Colon faces the Plaza in front of the Cathedral. The classic architecture is pleasing, and the location can't be beat. It's around the corner from the Palace of Music, quite close to the Ramblas, and near several of the historical museums. The area is honeycombed with smart shops and boutiques and restaurants are in abundance. The lobby is old fashioned with elegant and well-furnished public rooms. The bar is comfortable, and the dining room for breakfast is on the floor below. Breakfast was good and consisted of the standard fare. Pastries were above average here. Try the oblong fried dough things with custard filling and white sugar coating...no idea what they are called, but they're good. The room was comfortable with good woodwork and lots of built-in luggage and clothing storage. American hotels could learn a lot from this hotel. Draperies, bedspreads, and easy chairs upholstered in chintz. A small balcony overlooked the main Cathedral Square. Modern flat-screen TV with lots of channels, though most were not in English. Fully tiled bath/shower with double sink in vanity. Lots of amenities including shoe shine kit. Hot water and pressure good. Only two elevators, but they were pretty efficient. The best thing about this hotel was the location. It's convenient to much of what I wanted to see. We we able to walk almost everyplace. Favorite place nearby was a restaurant called El Pintor, Sant Honorat, 7, 08002 Barcelona; tel +34 93 301 40 05. This place was excellent with good service and wine list and a nice selection of Catalan specialties. I highly recommend it.
UR13214907	Very pretty, and perfectly located, we were received graciously and treated attentively throughout our stay. The bathroom was well appointed (the whirlpool bath and amenities were welcome after our long, international flight), and the dressing room/closet accommodated our American luggage better than most European hotels. We did not reserve a room with a view of the Cathedral, after seeing photos of it swathed in scaffolding on your website, but were happy with our (probably quieter) balcony on a high floor in the back. We not only had a rooftop view, but loved the Cathedral bells punctuating our days and nights. Although the room was simple, we were delighted to find reading lights bedside (another rare feature in European hotels). My husband was ill for much of our visit, and they were solicitous and accommodating above and beyond. All in all, an amazing value for the price, even with the Euro/dollar ratio.
UR13037665	We spent 3 nights at this hotel and found it comfortable and good value. The breakfast had fresh orange juice and decent coffee with the usual buffet and the rooms although not big were clean and comfortable with good water pressure in the bath and shower..Many have a balcony overlooking the square. It is sort of old fashioned but in a nice way. The area in January was uncrowded and lovely. The situation could not be better.It is off the large square facing the cathedral (the old one not the Gaudi one) in the Barri Gothic area which has little streets of specialist shops with every window a work of art. The Ramblas and the Marina are about ten minutes away. The cathedral is well worth going inside and is one of a series of beautiful churches in the area. A flock of geese live in the cloister garden, an ancient tradition it seems. It is possible to walk to the bus station and there are several Metro stops near. It is also unfortunately an area where you have to be careful of pickpockets and even in our group of four a young man came up to one of us and said 'I want to shake your hand' and put his arm round his shoulders and his hand went in the pocket. The rest of us saw this of course and grabbed him. He seemed quite scared and he ran off quickly when we let him go. So be very careful.
UR12417973	This is a 4 star hotel that should be 3. Unlike to what happens to Regencia de Colón. We booked a room in Regencia de Colon because we had been there before and we loved it. Besides that, this hotel was extremely expensive. When we got to the Regencia de Colon, they told us that we were going to be upgraded to the Colon one so we were very happy. However, our happyness only lasted a couple of minutes till we saw our room. It was tiny for a 4 star hotel (half of the side the Regencia´s one) dated, bare and it stank of smoke. Besides that we got a room that overlooked the cathedral which was on works so the noise was totally unbearable, specially in the mornings. The toilet was also old and quite dirty. We were very disappointed with the hotel and wanted to go back to the Regencia one but they told us that is was overbooked! So it was our last time in this chain.
UR12271554	Stayed for a few days over New Year at the Hotel Colon - set right next to the Cathedral (not the Gaudi one!) and almost everything in walking distance. Despite New Year revellers not too noisy and almost no traffic noise. Traditional in appearance and furnishing/fittings, with comfortable beds and excellent housekeeping - both cleanliness and service. Room with small balcony, but good wardrobe, safe, TV (internet very pricey though) and lighting. Bathroom well fitted but a little tired with a need for fresh sealant and grout in places but everything worked pefectly and well cleaned. Towels, gowns etc very good. Reception is of the old school and can be almost intimidating, though everything was done correctly and as asked. Some lessons in presentation and customer contact may be of benefit to some of the staff. Food - only had breakfast - was fine (but €16 if not on package)and bar (and minibar) prices very reasonable for a European city centre hotel. Waiters variable, looked as if more management needed to organise better. Plenty of good restaurants close by so no real need to eat in hotel - Taverna de Bisbe not bad across the square. Overall quite happy and would use again at the right price - should be able to get at around €150-180.
UR11686205	Good luck finding a better location for exploring central Barcelona than this. Placed just beside the Cathedral, the hotel is a perfect base for the shopping area. Within 2 minutes you find yourself in the tight cosy shoppingstreets of Barcelona. If you arrive at Plaza Catalunya, don't bother taking the subway or a taxi to the hotel, it is only a 5 minute walk from where the airport bus stops. We took the subway to the Jaime1 stop, but it is actually quicker just to walk. The hotel itself is overall a nice hotel. Not luxurious, but very comfortable. We got a room with two single beds, and asked wether they had one with a double, and without any problems the offered us one (however this was not as cosy as the first one so we decided to go for the originial one and just push the beds together). There was a tv with around 40 channels available in the room, and a mediacenter with lots of options (pay per view movies etc). Our bathroom also had a bathtub. A nice buffet breakfast was included in the room. We paid 88 euros pr.night in for our doubleroom, and will surely stay there again if we return to Barcelona.
UR11480653	The Colon Hotel is a perfectly central hotel in Barcelona, Spain that is situated just in front of the main facade of the Cathedral. It was a 5 cab ride or 20 walk away from Plaza Catalunya and the Port of Barcelona. My BBF and I went to Barcelona to celebrate our 30th birthdays. The hotel staff were wonderful! Anything that we needed, they would help us or get it for us. Our room was cleaned and refreshed everyday without issue and if we rang for the iron and iron board they brought one right up (though we could only have it for a short period of time) the service was still fast. The hotel manager actually sent me a bottle of wine and deserts on my birthday. It was such a surprise and it made my entire evening. The only concern was the limited television stations. They only had access to news stations and after a few days that became depressing, so we ordered movies, but then that got expensive.
UR11182412	Stayed here for 2 nights, the location was great, service was great, bar was nice to unwind in, after dinner. You can walk to all of the best tapas and people watching spots. Overall, the best place to stay in Barcelona
UR11038106	Went to Barcelona with a 15 month old. Hotel was great with him. They had a crib all set up for him. We got a suite with the large balcony that overlooks the cathedral. I would suggest this to everyone because the few extra bucks were worth the view.It was also great for my little one to run around on. As everyone has mentioned, the location was great. Close to La Rambla but far enough away to not deal with the noise. My husband enjoyed that we were close to the Hard Rock Cafe and a Starbucks. The location was great with the Taxi drivers because no matter what they knew the word cathedral. The front desk staff were very helpful. We needed to make many phone calls because our luggage had been lost from the flight. Never ate in the restaurant(very small)but did get room service. Was not impressed with the food so just go to a close cafe outside instead. As a warning if you sit outside then food costs more. It a different menu with different prices. Overall, it was a nice experience. I would definitely stay there again.
UR10936719	We have just returned from a weekend at Hotel Colon and can thoroughly recommend it. In fact this is the first time I have ever submitted a review and the hotel was so good it made us want to do it! Its centrally located for all 'sights' and easy to find - in a city where you need to find locations this is a real plus. (15 mins walk from airport bus, Bus Touristic - definitely go on and 5 mins from musuems and shops!). We did not eat an evening meal there but the breakfast was excellent and plentiful for the entire day! Room was lovely and we upgraded to a cathedral view room - well worth it.
UR10776213	I have stayed at the Hotel Colon on several occasions over a thirty year period. It is always a pleasure to return, as it is in a superb location in the Barri Gotic, directly facing the Gothic cathedral. The area between th e Colon and the cathedral is pedestrianised, so there is no traffic noise, and it is quiet at night. The Colon is a traditionally styled Hotel in the spirit of the turn of the century, although it was apparently re-constructed in the 1950's. The staff are friendly and helpful, and our grandchildren who accompanied us on a visit there last year, can vouch for the fact that it is a very child-friendly establishment too. The size and standard of the rooms is variable, depending on price,and could do with refurbishing, although the bathrooms are perfectly adequate. There is a very pleasant seating area at the front of the Colon, where you can just sit and have a beer, watching the world go by, or have a snack. The rest of the Gothic quarter is within easy walking distance as is the Rambla. Tour buses stop nearby on the Via Layetana, and taxis in Barcelona are plentiful and inexpensive. Try the "4 Gats" restaurant, five minutes walk away for lunch.
UR10642747	I have just returned from Barcelona and a 2-night stay at the Hotel Colon, ending a 10-night Riviera Cruise. I had 40 happy travelers with me who all enjoyed the hotel and the wonderful location. The staff was warm, friendly and very accommodating. It was the perfect ending to a 2-week stay in Europe. The hotel was very charming, and I would certainly stay there again when in Barcelona.
UR10271555	We spent one night here before embarking on a cruise. Our room was small but fine for one night. The beds were not great so I wouldn't recommend a long stay. There is a great tapas bar, Bilbao Berria, on the square that you should not miss.
UR10259047	We really enjoyed our stay at the Colon Hotel in Barcelona. We found the hotel to be charming and clean with efficient service. The daily breakfast (included with our stay) was great; eggs, bacon, sausage, cold cuts, fresh fruit, dessert selections, tea, coffee and orange juice freshly squeezed. The double bed was firm and not quite as plush as we would have chosen. Our room and towels/robes had a lavendar aroma that was a delight. Both times we requested room service (dinner one night and lunch another day) our orders were accurate and delivered in fifteen minutes or so. Dinner at the hotel's restaurant was excellent. If it hadn't been our last night, we would have dined there more. The hotel is directly across the plaza from the Cathedral, making the location in the city fantastic. Overall we were very pleased with our choice on this hotel for our stay in Barcelona.
UR10024579	Big, clean room, pretty quiet. Great location as it is right on the square opposite the cathedral. We also stayed a place on the Ramblas, but the Colon was in a much better location. Less touristy and more interesting bars and restaurants around (ie ones that Spaniards went to, with better food and lower prices than those near the Ramblas!) The only thing lacking for me was that there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room - a bit annoying! However I would recommend this hotel highly.
UR8840634	We have just returned from a 5 night stay in Barcelona at Hotel Colon and were originally drawn to consider this hotel from the reccommendation of an acquaintence who had stayed there. I followed this up by researching on Trip Advisor before booking and although most of the reviews rated it quite highly there were a few that made us a little apprehensive. Be sure not to confuse a review with the 2 Star 'Regencia' Colon Hotel which is located behind Hotel Colon itself! Comments about the excellent location of Hotel Colon are absolutely right! So perfect for exploring in every direction and in comparison to a lot of other hotels fronting noisy streets this position opposite the cathedral in a busy but relaxing square was ideal for a city location. Our room was superb - we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a large superior room in a corner position with two small balcony terraces and a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The room was clean and the air conditioning was efficient. Daily cleaning and topping up of complimentary supplies could not be faulted. Even our room service order for morning coffee arrived right on time. The hotel staff were very pleasant and professional and the porters were charming. They were more than happy to store our bags for a few hours on the day of departure and called a taxi when we were ready to go to the airport. A receipt was presented for us to use on collection of our luggage. All very efficient. One or two have commented about slow service at the outside cafe area. We expected this from reading the reviews and although we used this area 3-4 times, we did not find the wait intolerably long. A little consideration should be applied - when you are working in the heat a more measured pace is required. By contrast, if the waiting staff had been running back and forth in a scurry, the experience of relaxing in the shade at the edge of the square could well be spoiled. Even the padded cushions on the chairs added to the comfort. If there is any negative comment here, it is likely to be that some of the prices are a little expensive. Overall we would highly reccommend Hotel Colon and as a post script must say - we were a little reluctant paying so much for a hotel without a swimming pool, but in our case, the in-room jacuzzi was a better choice. After spending so many hours walking who knows how many miles each day, a few minutes in the jacuzzi was greatly appreciated and truly rejuvenating before going out for the evening, whereas a 'swim in the pool' may well have shortened the day!
UR8665323	My boyfriend have just come back from staying at Hotel Colon from 30 Aug to 3 Sept and loved it. The hotel is in a perfect location, in walking distance to everything, but surrounded by cafes, restaurants and bars in the Gothic Quarter. We were lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor with a large sun terrace which was total bliss. The minibar was pretty cheap by 4 star hotel standards and the breakfast was great, buffet style, although a little pricey at 15 euros per person. We would definitely return to Hotel Colon and if we could get a room with a terrace again, even better.
UR8493464	Hotel location was super, access to all of the main areas was easy from the cathedral square. The staff in the hotel were very attentive always helping with either requests for taxis or general tourist enquiries. I would recommend this hotel as it is central and relatively good value for money. I recommend that people who wish to get around the main attractions in Barcelona use the Bus Touristic. This has 3 routes and you can jump on and off as many times as you like. We bought the 2 day ticket which was 23 euros each but, meant that we could take our time to see the sights ( Nou camp, Sagrada familia etc).
UR8473416	My husband and I stayed here for several nights in mid-August and we really felt pampered. We had a wonderful king size room with a Cathedral view and it was just lovely. The hotel is old-school, rather than funky modern but in wonderful condition. We are seasoned travelers so we don't ordinarily ask the hotel staff for much but I frequently saw other American guests drilling the staff for all kinds of advice (I'm guessing these people don't travel much or they've been told that Barcelona is dangerous). They did give us a sheet of paper describing all the things that we (tourists) should be aware of, like pickpockets, wandering around alleys at night, 3 card monty type card tricks, etc). We saw nothing of the sort and we were out wondering and riding the metro. I'm sure this stuff happens but if you look the part, then you might be more likely to have it happen to you. In any event, the location is great, just steps from the Cathedral and the gothic quarter, which is great. And about a 20 minute walk to the waterfront and beaches. The beach areas are really cool, with lots of bars and restaurants that come alive at night. There is a great food market near the hotel (the roof looks like a multi-colored pixel screen). They did have a band playing in the plaza next to the hotel on Sat night until about 2am. It didn't really bother us because we sleep with earplugs but if you don't want the noise, you need to make sure you don't get a room facing the plaza/cathedral. They do charge for internet access which you can get directly from your tv, but it was pricey...9.50 E for a 24hour period. That also gives you access to other online benefits but we never explored those (DVDs, etc). If you are accustomed to high end hotels, this is a good one. Not the most expensive in town but comfortable and well appointed.
UR8190104	I had a short 5 days holiday in Barcelona at Hotel Colon - July 2007. Hotel was excellent, location was excellent and also Barcelona! I recommend the hotel, excellent servicies, food and traditional athmosphere in the Cathedral Square, just outside in front of the hotel!
UR8117045	Hotel sits adjacent to the small plaza in front of the Cathedral where there is a lot of activity especially on weekends. Many Americans were there so it seems like the great location is well known. The rooms were nothing special but they were clean and fairly modern. The porters were top notch. Always there to help get your bags up into the lobby, friendly, and willing to help answer questions. Can't say the same thing for the staff behind the reception desk. Seemed irritated (more than once) when we asked to put our laptop in their safe even though their literature requested us to do so. None of them seemed customer oriented. As unfriendly as the staff was, I'd stay there again because of the excellent location. The locals perform their Catalan dance (Sardana) with a band on Saturdays and Sundays and there was almost always some kind of performer playing (and selling CDs). If you ask for a room facing the Cathedral you can enjoy the entertainment from your balcony. If you can get above the 2nd or 3rd floor, even better. This was a great treat for us. Many other top tourist sites are not far away. A Starbucks is located just across the street so a relatively cheap breakfast can be had along with American style coffee. The Cathedral is being refurbished (as are a lot of buildings in Barcelona), so we were unable to enjoy the view as much as we would have liked.
UR8091306	We stayed at the Hotel Colon for 3 nights - 29th June to 2nd July. The reception staff were all really friendly and helpful, and we were able to easily upgrade our room with no extra charge. The rooms were comfortable and clean. We were allocated a twin room with a balcony, which was at the side of the hotel, which was fine as we were able to sit out on it and people watch. The only drawback with staying at the hotel is given it's location, it can be quite noisy in the night when you're trying to sleep. I had to shut the balcony doors to get some sleep as dustbin men were emptying glass bottle banks at about 2am!! The hotel is perfectly located, right opposite the cathedral and there is always something going on in the square. There is a cafe attached to the hotel. However, if takes an eternity to get served. Cafe staff often walking past you without asking if you want anything. We sat there for 15 mins one morning before finally deciding to give up and go elsewhere. There is also a restaurant, which we ate in on our last day, which is reasonably priced and the food is good. All in all, it's really the location that makes this hotel.
UR7999707	Like other reviews, I can't say enough about the great location of this Hotel. You are within walking distance of almost all the major sites (include Picasso Museum, Las Ramblas, etc.), though you'll need to take the metro to see Sagrada Familia. Do request a room facing the Cathedral, though, as the rooms on the side don't have the view. Helpful, English-speaking lobby staff and extremely friendly (if less English-speaking) service staff. If this is your first European hotel, just be prepared for the small rooms. Bring your own hair dryer (with an adaptor for European plugs). They've got one in the room, but it's a rinky-dink thing. They have the AC set at minimum and maximum levels, so be aware of this if you like it cold. Get tapas at the little cafe next to the Diocesan museum (across from the hotel) and coffee at the cafe down on the west end of the plaza.
UR7959074	This hotel was perfect for us... located in the Gothic district, directly across from the Cathedral (request a room facing the Cathedral), close to Las Ramblas, and we were upgraded to a suite (without having to ask). The rooms are average decor, clean, great service at the front desk... poor service from the Bartender when we attempted to get lunch in the bar area.
UR7582754	My husband and I just spent 4 nights at this hotel, May 3 -7, 2007. We had a dbl. Cathedral view room. We paid 210.00 Euro's per night. The furnishings consisted of 2 twin beds pushed together, 2 small chairs along with a side table and end table. The chairs were not comfortable so when I wanted to read I went down stairs to the lobby area and sat in their larger more comfortable chairs. We had a small balcony, I emphasize small, but it was nice to be able to look out over the square. The room was small compared to American standards but clean and comfortable. There was a TV that didn't get good reception and also intenet access. It was 9 Euros for 24 hr. use of the internet so we did that for one day. The keyboard didn't work so my husband called and they sent someone up right away to fix it. My only real complaint was the bathroom. The bathroom is small and the bidet sits right in front of the toilet. There's a very small amount of room for your legs and feet when you're sitting on the toilet. There is a restaurant on sight which we did not eat at but did sit outside and enjoyed a Sangria. The front desk staff were very nice. They do speak English. The hotel is located directly across from the Barcelona Cathedral which is covered in scaffolding. The location is wonderful. It's in the Gotic area of Barcelona so you can walk everywhere - which we did. I recommend this hotel to people who aren't going to spend much time in their room. I'm a coffee lover but found their coffee a bit strong and expensive for my taste. We were delighted to find there were 2 Starbucks within a block of the hotel.
UR7481412	I stayed at the Colon for a weekend in April with a friend and had a lovely experience here. We were initially given an 'internal' room which was small and claustrophobic with no view. We asked to be given a room with a balcony with more air and space and were obliged with no problem. The room were spotless and cleaned daily. The mini bar was retocked as required and not as expensive as some hotels I have stayed in. All staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fresh, restocked regularly and tasty although I have had better breakfast in lower star hotels. The location of this hotel is fantastic particularly if you get a room with a view of the square. Noise from the square is a problem but once the windows and shutters are closed it's fine. The weather was sunny and warm when we stayed but the air conditioning system had not been switched on in the hotel. I would imagine any warmer and it would become unbearable without air con. My only negative comment really would be the 'internet connection' in the room. We tried to download our photographs onto the TV but the hotel ask for payment for this facility which I feel should be offered free. Overall a lovely hotel and I would definately stay here again.
UR7402529	Hotel was fantastic, good location, friendly staff, plenty for breakfast. Our room was ok, bit of a squash fitting the camp bed in as a third bed, but hey, you're only really in your room for sleeping! so it didn't really bother us. Rooms are very clean, bathroom was good size, with plenty of toiletries, clean towels everyday. Chocolates were left on your pillow, which was a nice touch. Excellent location, facing the Catherdral, which is magnificent inside, lots of scaffolding around it as currently being cleaned. Plenty of bars, cafe bars and shops around the hotel and it was nice to sit in the Catherdral Square watching the world go by. Wonderful ice cream shop not far from the hotel - give it a try!! only 5 minute walk from La Rambles, The Port and all the designer shops. We would definitely recommend and stay at the hotel again.
UR7368565	Great location to use as a base for enjoying Barcelona. The rooms are expensive but worth it. Staff is helpful. Nice lobby and overall fine quality general areas. Individual rooms are spacious .
UR7246755	this was my first hotel experience outside the US. This hotel was not bad. The room was small, but very well decorated and it faced the catheral. The staff was friendly and the room was kept spotless. Nice bathroom as well. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was pricey, but very good. As far as the noise level, there was no noise it was great! Will stay there again if we travel again to Europe.
UR7229542	We were a bit afraid to stay in the tourist center of Barcelon, but the Hotel Colon on the Cathedral Square of the Barrio Gotic, was wonderful. We arrived very late ( 2 a.m. ) and the staff was very helpful in advising us about parking our car in the underground garage a few feet away. ( They get half-rate prices there and gave us an in and out card ). The room was good sized, with a place for everything. Clean, pretty and the double paned windows kept it quiet. Bathroom supples always fully replaced every day. Our balcony overlooked the Cathedral Square and it was truly magical, despite the fact that scaffolding covered the front of the Cathedral for a cleaning. BUT, this was more than made up for when we had a front-row seat to watch the locals dance the Sardinera (sp?) , the lovely Catalan dance, in the square to a live orchestra on Saturday afternoon. Staff at the Colon was always helpful, and English speaking. We would go back there and recommed it highly.
UR7161042	this hotel is amazing! its located directly across from one of the best pasta places i've ever been to and conviently located walking distance from many shops. The beaches are only about a 20 minute walk from the hotel as well. The service was great and i would recomend this hotel to anyone!
UR6901201	I had a great stay at this hotel. Got a nicely renovated single - although very small - room with a flat-screen multimedia TV. There was not much of a view - but I only needed to step out of the foyer to take in the breathtaking view of the old catedral and explore the old city, The room was clean and nice. I decided not to take breakfast at the hotel, as there are several cafés in the neighborhood where you can find it cheaper. Got a good price of €90/night at HRS. If I should say something negative it should be the hard pillows and the very poor hair dryer.
UR6627609	Great hotel! We stayed there for 3 nights. It has an awesome location and its a 5 min walk to Las Ramblas. The double decker bus has a stop at the stop light. The cathedral is still under renovation. The morning breakfast is excellent. The best breakfast we had during our 3 week trip to Europe! Not much more to say that hasn't already been shared. If you are traveling by train from the airport, get off on Plaza Catalunya. Its about a 10 min walk. Just ask for the cathedral and you'll find your way.
UR6615538	The hotel is in an excellent position for shops etc Our room 302 was awful - some lights not working, the old damaged furniture, awful non-matching wallpaper, old ropey bed - the room was like a prison cell and not terribly clean either. We tried to talk to the front desk about our disappointment with the room but chap not very interested. Would not recommend this hotel
UR6553050	The previously discussed benefits of the Colon's location (right next to the gothic cathedral and in the middle of the Barri Gotic (gothic quarter) make for the above-average rating and outweigh the negative of abundant street and in-hotel noise. During our three day stay the staff were extremely nice and helpful at making reservations and helping us navigate around Barcelona. Rooms were comfortable enough (beds were short, so maybe reconsider if you're over 6'2", and these aren't Park Hyatt beds or sheets) and bathroom was more than adequate for 3 of us to share. If you want to stay in the Barri Gotic, it's hard to imagine being better situated than the Colon. The noise is understandable, given the nonstop activity along the old streets, but if you're a light sleeper you should bring ear plugs.
UR6543900	My younger daughter and I just returned from 10 days in Barcelona and Rome, and we spent a total of 6 nights at Hotel Colon and couldn't have been more pleased. We came to spend Christmas with my older daughter, who is studying this year at the University of Barcelona. The hotel was extremely convenient for us, since she lives just a couple blocks away. It's close to everything, and we walked everywhere or took the metro. The lobby is huge, the staff fell over themselves helping with luggage and questions, and the rooms were very spacious, especially by European standards. (I've had rooms in some of the nicer resorts in Vegas that were smaller!) The first 4 nights we had a nice double room, with a slight view of the cathedral and plaza from the little balcony. We were angled on the side, but close to the front. The cathedral is covered with scaffolding, so I didn't pay extra for a front facing room. The bathroom was large, with enormous robes, slippers and a basket full of toiletries. With the window shut, it was very quiet, but we often cracked open the window because the room was a bit on the warm side and there didn't seem to be any way to control it. We left for Rome for 3 days (stayed on Hotel Sonya, which wasn't the greatest), then returned to Barcelona and Hotel Colon for 2 more nights. The 2nd time we had an even bigger room, with a sitting area. This was more to the back, so no view. My only complaint was in this room, the bathroom lighting was pretty dismal. But I was extremely pleased with this hotel - the location, price, amenities, staff, etc, were all wonderful. I will definitely stay here again, should I return to Barcelona.
UR6438228	I stayed before and after my cruise at this hotel. It was a better choice and half the price that the cruise line was asking for pre and post stays. The hotel is across from the cathedral and in the center of all the attractions. The a/c didnt work one night and they give me another room immeaditly after calling the front desk. The hotel was very clean and the lobby had many comfortable sitting areas The rooms were fairly large by european standards. Its not worth it to pay 90 dollars more for a cathdral view and balcony when the cathdral is covered with scalfold. I would stay again the next time i am in barcelona.
UR6162083	This hotel is terrible. You are better off in a hostel. It has no right to advertise as 4 or 5 star hotel. We booked almost seven months in advance and they were offering a long-stay discount at that time that gave you a 15% discount, which we secured. We just got a standard type room and our rate was about $150USD with the discount. When we checked in we were given an absolutely terrible tiny room with two twin beds, even though I requested a king. We called and asked to be moved to a room with one bed and were told we would have to wait until the next day to move. The hotel advertises that it has air conditioning in all rooms. It has a knob on the wall that looks like a thermostat control, but believe me, it doesn't work. The only way to get any air in is to open the windows or balcony. The hotel is in a very busy area and there is non-stop noise. We were literally directly above a cafe and it was ridiculously noisy. The first night we pulled the beds together away from the one wall and the paint was completely peeling off the walls and all over the floor. The bathroom was dirty looking and the room smelled bad. It was awful, but we hoped for a better new room the next day. When we went down the next day to get a new room we asked if they had anything nicer and quieter. The front desk was very helpful in showing us several different rooms. We were offered a cathedral view room for 290Euros! We looked at it and it smelled bad and was absolutely not worth it. There are much nicer hotels to be had in Barcelona for this amount. So they showed us another room that was also smallish and dirty but at least had one bed. The gentleman that showed it to us assured us it was on a quiet street that was actually closed to traffic and could only be used by the hotel behind us, which was a lie. We were told we could have the room if we hurried and moved. So we took the new room which was a slight improvement. This room also had NO air conditioing or fan to speak of. We had to keep all the winodws and the "balcony" door open all the time to even be able to breathe- I am not talking about keeping the room cool, I am just talking about getting enough air in that you don't roast, and this was in November! It is so loud outside 24 hours a day there is no way you can sleep. Non-stop motorcycles, scooters, shouting, banging, breaking bottles, construction, emptying of trash cans, screaming people. Even if it was quieter, there is no way you can sleep on the miserable uncomfortable beds. The bed clothes are awful and uncomfortable and it is impossible to get additional pillows. Housekeeping is almost nonexistent. They remake your bed, and that's about it. They do not replace tolietries or do much else. I understand that this is European hotel, but it is certainly not a 4-star hotel as they claim. For the price you can find a much better place in Barcelona with much better service. Most of the time if you had a request or a question you were treated with restrained disdain. When we checked out and asked for the doorman to get us a taxi he said he would call one. It was obvious he knew the driver and they were talking and lauging as they helped us get our stuff in the car. They were obviously saying things about us, but our Spanish is not great. The taxi driver then made about 3 different turn arounds on the highway, each time purposely missing the airport exits. Our cab ride ended up being more than twice as expensive as the ride from the airport to the hotel 6 days earlier! This is just one example of several of the "seedy" type incidents we experienced at the hotel. The location is great and Barcelona is an amazing city, so you don't want to spend much time in your room anyway, but it would have been nice to at least have a comfortable place to go back to sleep in at night. Part of our problem came from getting a cheaper rate I am sure, so they wanted to stick us with a subpar room- but they also showed us the 290 Euro room, and that was definitely not worth it at all either. I would not reccomend this hotel to anyone.
UR6160696	We stayed for 2 nights in Mid Nov. in a room on the top floor with a very large Verandah, which a limited view of the Cathedral (which is covered 80% with Scaffolding). Of all the staff members we came across only one did not meet the grade. The only noise we could hear was the lift going up and down as it was outside our door, but it didnt stop us from sleeping, and i am quite a light sleeper. We arrived early (11am) to drop off our bags and as the room was ready they allowed us to check in then. I agree it is in a fantastic location for exploring the entire city. I didnt eat or drink at the hotel, there are too many good restaurants and bars to explore around the city to spend your time in a hotel! I was generally very pleased with the experience.
UR6106722	Just got back from a seven night stay at this lovely hotel. Location is great—directly across from the scaffolding-draped Cathedral (bummer). Couldn't have asked for a better location. Hotel itself was very nice: staff friendly and helpful, room was fine, bathroom fine too. Had a nice little balcony overlooking an alley. Close to restaurants, subway, Placa de Catalunya, about four blocks to the right of La Rambla, stores, and in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Will definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.
UR5625777	Firstly, the Colon is not one of the designer boutique hotels that Barcelona abounds with, so if this is what you're expecting you'll be dissapointed. It's a traditional European style four star, with all of the typical facilities that you would expect - a concierge to take your luggage at the door, a well decorated lobby, a beautiful bar, and excellent room service. I stayed in a single room - definitely the biggest single I've ever experienced. The integrated TV was also a bonus as I hadn't brought my laptop, however the mouse on the keyboard was a little frustrating. The reception on the English language TV channels is also poor (and there are only news English language channels - CNN & SkyNews - I would recommend introducting at least the BBC world service). But the room was extremely comfortable (especially the bed), the bathroom was large and spotless, and the room's quaint decor was a nice oasis to retreat to. The hotel's location is of course it's real selling point. Directly opposite the Cathedral in the Venetian-style Barri Gothic, once you step out of the doors on to the square, it's obvious that you're on holidays. The Cathedral square is a fun place to people-watch, with plenty of bar terraces, and there's often live band entertainment in the evenings. This area is also a lot less seedy, safer, and more well-lit than the areas where many of the other four stars are located in Barcelona. On my return to Barcelona, I'll definitely be heading straight back to the Colon.
UR5619960	After reading the reviews I felt that hotel colon would be ideal...sadly I was wrong I have never met such rude hotel staff in all my life, the hotel room looked as old as it smelt, and I could hear every time the people next to me went to the toilet. I hated the hotel so much that the only time I spent their was to sleep……although that was rarely possible due to the noise and constant building work at the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an enjoyable holiday, instead I would recommend that the staff take a course in customer service and that the hotel gets a total refurbishment
UR5591749	The Hotel Colon was a good choice for Barcelona, with an excellent central location opposite the cathedral, smart, professional service and good physical appearance throughout. Our ‘triple deluxe’ room was large and spacious, with a well proportioned bathroom, complete with (heart shaped?!) Jacuzzi bath. The room also featured a modern flat screen LCD television (as all the rooms do, from what we saw) with a range of ‘interactive’ services like music, games, local information etc. This was a bonus, as many hotels – even ones of a similar calibre – still have woefully old fashioned television facilities (small screen bulky black-box televisions, few channels etc.) There was a fairly large selection of channels, including the usual English language suspects (Sky News, CNN, CNBC etc.). The usual four star amenities including telephone, minibar, hair dryer and air conditioning were not missing either: the air conditioning was very effective and crucially was silent as well, unlike in many hotels where it is too loud to be kept on at night and thus you don’t stay cool. The beds were hard (by American/British standards), but not uncomfortable. It was, however, a shame that the room was not very well sound-proofed even though the air conditioning was silent: there were double glazed windows and shutters, but sound from the street was not blocked out at all. Luckily the street directly outside wasn’t at all busy, but there were disturbances like deliveries, mopeds and the removal of refuse from the hotel. Also there was a pipe duct in the bathroom, so sounds from the pipes – including the drain pipes from rooms directly above – could easily be heard. The service was efficient, if not somewhat cold and business-like, but the hotel seemed equally well suited for business and leisure visitors. The breakfast buffet was good but not exceptional. Overall, this hotel wasn’t perfect but is still a good choice in a great location.
UR5559686	Yes, the cathedral is still covered in scaffolding. Luckily we didn't pay for the cathedral view. This is a great hotel with friendly staff. Room was very clean and well furnished. Bathroom is large - and I still don't understand these European hairdryers. (If you have longer hair they take forever to get your hair dry.) No view from the back side of the hotel. Great Breakfast. Would stay again.
UR5542231	Hotel Colon is a great hotel :- Location - you could not get more central opposite the cathedral and close to attractions, restaurants and shopping Rooms - clean, the best pillows, cool & quite air-conditioning, chocolates in the evening, LCD TV & DVD Hotel - traditional style, well-maintained Street Cafe - cool, good service, good quality (try the sangria with a kick) Staff - friendly, informative and helpful Made our trip. Stayed - 29 July - 2 August
UR5526645	Fantastic Hotel - right in the Gothic Quarter, directly opposite the old Catherderal (not the Goyer one). We paid extra for a Catherderal view room - it was worth it!
UR5480335	Having read many varying reviews on many different hotels across Barcelona I was slightly disheartened and concerned about which to book. However, I decided upon the 4* Hotel Colon in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. I was very impressed with this hotel and would definitely stay there again if I was returning to the city. It is very central indeed, being a 5 mins walk from Las Ramblas and from the metro station, should you wish to travel slightly further afield. The staff were very helpful, the rooms were kept very clean, being made up each day without fail. The only two very minor complaints I would have would be that you may find yourself waiting at the Reception desk a while as they do tend to answer and stay on the phone, even if you are mid conversation. The other being that the mini bar was not always re-stocked every day. Our room did not have a facing view of the cathedral but this did not bother us at all (particularly as it is currently covered in scaffolding), it did however have a small balcony. The area can be quite noisy but you would never be able to tell once you have shut the doors to the balcony. They are fully double glazed and keep out all noise. The efficient air conditioning system makes it unnecessary to open these during the night anyway. The bathroom was well equipped with toiletries etc. plus dressing gowns/matching slippers and a great power shower. It was slightly expensive at Â£120 per room per night but well worth it for the comfort and the location. I would recommend it to anyone.
UR5464101	My wife and I have just spent 3 nights at the Colon Hotel. We found it to be in an ideal location close to Las Ramblas and the Port. The bus tours are close at hand and all the sights in easy reach. The hotel itself was superb with friendly staff and clean and well proportioned rooms. Our only criticism was no tea or coffee making facilities. However we would definately recommend this hotel and use it again for a return visit.
UR5030585	We stayed in this hotel as it received the best reviews, for this level of hotel, and had a lack of "noise at night" comments. It delivered on all accounts. We stayed on the Gastronomic stay offer - 2 nights B&B with dinner on one night for €199 each. It works out at about £40 more than room only but the breakfast is very good and varied and the dinner - a "tasting" menu so you get 7 courses but some are just a mouthful! which is very well presented and has been prepared to a high standard, in fact it is better than a lot of 5* food I have experienced. Room wise - we had room 414 which was being used to trial a fully interactive LCD TV with Internet, games etc. which was nice as you could check look up guides on the net for free! The room, although being on the side of the hotel, has a balcony so you can stand on that and look at the cathedral - which is covered in scaffolding! Staff were friendly and doormen deserve a mention as genuinely taking an interest in you and not just holding out for a €1 tip! Barcelona ia a great place, didn't feel threatened/at risk form pickpockets etc. Like all major cities, it's the luck of the draw where crime is concerned. If you don't go to dodgy areas then you should be ok.
UR4993021	We stayed here over the Easter period and found it a wonderful hotel. The staff were extrememly courteous and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We had booked a room with a terrace and cathedral view and we were not disappointed even though the cathedral is covered in scaffolding. I was aware of this before we went anyway. Great fun watching all that was going on in the square frome a 'birds eye' view! and well worth the extra money. Barcelona is a lovely city and you can walk for miles just looking at things. Unfortunately when we tried to visit the Picasso Museum (twice) the queus were so long and were likely to tack a good hour to clear so we didn't get in. The harbour area is a great place to people watch.
UR3738432	I found the reception staff most helpful and efficient but I do wonder how much commission is on offer for arranging tickets for the bullfight (for my parnter, not for me...) and the flamenco/dinner show (which was excellent by the way). Perhaps I am being just a tad cynical? The location is excellent (but a map on offer at check-in would have been appreciated) and is an easy walk both to La Ramblas and to the warren of streets that make up the Barri Gothic. Also close to the square where you catch the City Tour buses without whom many of the tourist attractions of the city would be less accessible. Our big corner room was excellent with two sets of french doors to two small (not sit on) balconies and a bathroom with two sinks and ever replenished supplies of products including toothbrushes and razors. Also, the cleanliness of the room (and of the hotel itself) was very good. (The excellent double glazing of the french doors was much appreciated given that there is building work next to the hotel. I certainly wouldn't let that put you off.) Having travelled to Barcelona from Girona where I stayed in a very good (but characterless) 4**** modern hotel I found the "faded granduer" of Hotel Colon rather welcome and comforting.
UR3704151	I just came back from Barcelona. I stayed at the Hotel Colon in the Gothic quater. Lovely hotel, great location. Barcelona is a fun and friendly city.
UR3457471	HOTEL COLON BARCELONA, Avenida Catedral, 708002,Barcelona. We arrived at the hotel early afternoon after our flight from Newcastle-upon-Tyne by Easyjet. The journey from the airport being by airport bus(very cheap, and not too crowded) to Catalunya Square, only five minutes walk from the hotel. When we checked in, we were shown to a room which only had a window looking into a lightwell, so, as it was our 35th Wedding Anniversary the following Monday, we decided to upgrade to a room with a balcony overlooking the Cathedral Square. The extra cost was worth it, as that weekend Pope John Paul II died, and the singing of the faithful, waiting to enter the Cathedral to pray, whilst sorrowful, was most moving. The hotel staff were most attentive, speaking excellent English, and were a fount of advice on the attractions of the city. The weather that weekend was a mix of warm, but windy days, and cool nights. The city tours were good value, particularly a second day for only 4€ extra, enabling us to select where we wanted to get off for a more in-depth visit at our own pace, (we are in our fifties, the mind still thinking as we did twenty years ago, but the body is tiring), especially the Familia Sagrada Cathedral, Goudi's House and Park, and the football stadium with all those trophies that would put English clubs' trophy rooms to shame. The column commemorating the discoveries of Columbus was a good visit, even if the elevator was crowded with only four plus the operator. The view over the city was excellent at dusk, with the sun setting behind the hills above the city. Overall, the city visit was good value, and would be considered for a visit in the future, after other cities on our list have been visited
UR3295268	We just returned from Barcelona with our two children, ages 14 and 20. As many reviews have stated, the location is wonderful. But, unfortunately, I did not use an on-line booking service but paid top dollar and I was amazed at how little was provided for this price. Breakfast was not included, there was no coffee available in the morning and there was very little interest in providing information about the area. We booked a suite which was adequate for 4 people but had only one bathroom. We were charged $38 extra a night for the 4th person. In all, I would not stay there again for this kind of money. We paid $298/euros a night plus the $38 extra for my daughter - Way too much money. And the cathedral is under renovation which is not too attractive - not the hotel's fault. But, there was a huge flea market in the plaza out front which was never mentioned. We were there on Palm Sunday and there were wonderful festivities right on the plaza but the hotel staff never mentioned anyhting about these things. So, I'd rather walk a few more blocks, save a huge amount of money, and get a few more amenities next time.
UR3275409	The staff is wonderful and the hotel itself beautiful, it's location tends to be quite noisy especially on the weekends. It is centrally located to everything and along with that comes everyone wanting to be centrally located. Keep in mind Spain does not really start waking up until 8pm. Be prepared. The rooms were always clean as well as the baths. Both are spacious.
UR3195116	Hotel currently undergoing an upgrade which means that there are builders and decorators on the premises from 8am. Also, there is extensive building work going on outside (it's next to a building site) which means between 8am and 7pm you can hear pneumatic drills and "colorful" language! Staff were not particularly helpful and the whole place is in dire need of a clean up. Would not stay there again.
UR3172927	I didn't think that the hotel was THAT great. They upgraded us to a Cathedral View room with a large balcony (larger than the bathroom and bedroom combined) on the top floor but I wasn't impressed. For the rating that the hotel has and the price I wasn't expecting: puke/avocado green kitch wallpaper and bed cover that hasn't been washed for a while, spotted carpet, A/C that was working when you turned on the heat, an outdated bathroom with kitchen motif tiles and plastic $1.99 patio furniture. The staff seamed like we had to been service oriented towards them instead the other way around with few exceptions like our bell boy and one lady at the front desk. My husband loved the view of the cathedral and didn't mind the gas company's sign since it covered a part that was being restored. He enjoyed the music and dancing that took place in the plaza up front. The location was great, we could walk to las Ramblas or anywhere else, where you can take the matro to the rest of the city. This was the 1st time I stayed in a hotel in Barcelona, so I am not sure how good or expensive are others with the same star rating.
UR3009391	The Colon has such a great location. Just across the square from the Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter. A Cathdral View room lets you watch the traditional dancing on a Sunday afternoon and watch the busy stall holders when they hold the antique market. Our Cathedral View was based upon hanging out the window and stretching your neck akwardly. We stayed here after a previous visit to it's less illustrious sibling, the Regencia Colon. It's a good clean hotel, but it's virtues are well overstated, and it's reputation, together with Barcelona's popularity, ensures it's expensive, even though it's rooms are smaller than many others in Barcelona. It's in the middle of everything though and very close to Ramblas and several Metro stations that can take you anywhere in the city. The concierge knows where the best restaurants are, and his advice is invaluable, even to a seasoned traveller to Barca, though the rest of the staff are a bit laissez-faire. While we were there, there were some MTV producers at the hotel, and we seemed to just get in the way of the hotel staff looking after these more important guests. It will cost you more to stay at this 4 star hotel than at many of Barca's 5 star hotels, but you get individually designed rooms, with real furniture, rather than corporate hotel fitted furniture, and you won't be splashing out on taxis to get around to the nightspots either as most are in walking distance. I would recommend it for one stay in the city as it is as synonymous with Barcelona as is La Sagrada Familia, Gaudi or a cold glass of Estrella Damm beer. But there are much better places to go back to stay at; it isn't worth it to stay here just to save a taxi fare back to a hotel which is further afield.
UR128276770	definitely a place to stay for those who want to party into the wee hours. And in our room facing La Rambla, we could hear them. So this convenience is a blessing and a curse at the same time. The room is understandably not big, as real estate is precious at this part of the town. Room is clean. Free wifi in the room. Front desk happily lent me a power adapter to plug in my American electronics.
UR127680946	2nd time staying here, both for business but would certainly consider for vacations. Ideally located right on the Ramblas great for people watching, metro, bus and supermarket with plenty of restaurant and bar choices. Rooms were roomy and clean I particularly liked the lights that changed colour in the shower! We arrived early and we were able to check in similarly they will happily store luggage in a secure area. Breakfast was ample with a good choice, friend had Tapas style supper and felt it gave good value for money...unlike Amatxu (unsure of the spelling) restaurant nearby. Watch out to be lured in by the 'specials' to find they flog you off their most expensive of bottle of wine saying that it is the House wine. Although the hotel lobby/bar is a bit atmosphereless all staff were very obliging and helpful and you could do a lot worse than to use this hotel as a base for exploring Barcelona. They also have a great roof terrace for views!
UR126075621	Stayed there for 4 nights with som friends. Great location on La Rambla. The rooms were nice and clean. There was some noice from La Rambla at night in the rooms facing La Rambla. But I guess we should expect that. Maybe wise to ask for a room facing the backyard? Great breakfast. 10 hot dishes, fresh fruits and a variety of other things. Air condition worked as it should. The lobby bar was often not serviced. Unfortunately there is a lot of prostitutes on La Rambla during the night. Anoying when you go back to your hotel at night, as they follow you up the street. But that is not the hotels fault. All in all, we found the hotel very nice and located right where it happens in Barcelona.
UR124562261	Great location and near to almost everything. We got excellent advice on restaurants and bars etc from the friendly and knowlegable front desk staff. We had a corner room on the second floor. Very nice. Good bathroom even if water from the shower flowed around the splash screen and flooded the floor. Stuck a towel on the edge, problem solved. Breakfast was good but the prepared food (eggs, meats etc) was warm at best. Great crispy bread rolls and good coffee. Although they advertise a fitness room and sauna in their printed brochure in the room, the staff told me that the fitness room has been closed for 2 years. The website still refers to the sauna but that was not available during our stay. I would stay there again.
UR123834063	This hotel is ideal for being at the centre of the Ramblas. It is walking distance to lots of attractions and in the evening it is easy to find restaurants and bars without going too far from the beaten track. I stayed for 2 nights and the room was clean and tidy. The only problem was the air con, it was too hot even blowing warm when i set it to 5degrees, and then when i opened the window it wouldn't close, but one call to reception and within 5 minutes it was closed.
UR123691549	Fantastic location just south of Placa Catalunya on the Ramblas. Easy walk just about anywhere. Airport bus takes you right to the placa for only 5.3 euro. Hotel was clean and orderly and staff helpful. Its a short walk to a number of Gaudi works including the Sagrda Familia. Off season rates a great value
UR123437101	The Rivoli is well positioned close to the top of Las Ramblas, most of the staff are friendly and the hotel is clean and well laid out. As a regular vistor I do ten to get my room upgraded but I were to be honest I usually end up at the front of the hotel overlooking Las Ramblas. During the weekdays this isn't a problem, however over the weekend its like being at a football stadium until 4 am. My best advice is make sure that you get a room at the rear of the hotel unless of course you are a party goer and plan to stay out well into the early hours.......... Overall the hotel is comfortable and the staff are very helpful, the rooms are "boutique" style and there are very few internal period features left in the hotel. The food is appropriate for the star rating. I think you pay more for the position of the hotel than it's elegance.......
UR121057052	The location was great. My fiance and I did not spend much time in the room, but we were in and out a lot. The location was ideal. The huge problem occurred when I noticed bug bites on my forehead, hands, feet, arms, left leg and back. There were ants on the floor, in the bathroom and in the bed. I informed the front desk, and they came up to look, issued a curt apology and gave us a new "upgraded" room (rm 502). The "upgraded" room had two couches we put our luggage on and was next to a loud couple/group. I guess two couches and a curt apology are all ant bites, allergic reactions, multiple days of itching and applying Allergic cream are worth. A waived lockbox fee or dinner/drink coupons would have been sufficient; however, nothing above moving to another slightly upgraded room (which we had to pack our stuff and move which resulted in delayed dinner plans and evening) was all that was offered. I emailed the hotel after my trip, and I did not receive a response. I think the hotel is in a great location and the staff was helpful about activities in the area; however, ants and poor customer service has tarnished my opinion of the hotel. Aaron
UR121006634	good hotel. small room (even for European standards). very clean. not too noisy. if you like to be on the Ramblas street, it is right in the middle. Personal helpfull. free internet. price high but OK for the street. had sandwich at the bar, OK. For breakfast, expensive if you take the buffet. we ordered croissant and coffee, Waitress not very smily. beds comforfable. gppd air condition. RAmblas street over rated (mostly restaurants and little shops in the middle. personel ordered a taxi for airport and made sure the driver knew where we were going.
UR120838536	I have stayed in this hotel several times while visiting Barcelona and I intend to use it again when I go there. Location is excellent, right on La Rambla and the hotel even has rooms with balcony that overlook the street. Rooms that look to the back are not bad either as the hotel has a great garden and a restaurant. Rooms are very big, bathrooms are huge as well. Clean, interesting architecture, friendly and helpful staff. Just across the hotel is a huge supermarket and a great outdoor market (beautiful fruits, veggies, salamis everything-highly recommend to visit) is a few blocks down the street. Plenty of restaurants and food stands are near by. The area behind the hotel is a very interesting part of the old city with many small shops. Staff at the hotel was so helpful that they even took care to get me a female taxi driver as I was leaving to the airport at 3am. I appreciated that. Also two staff members were up at that time (this happened twice) and ready to help me with my luggage.
UR120532120	The location is excellent right in the "heart" of Barcelona, next to Catalunya square. Touristc double decker bus station is nearby (2 min walking). The hotel is good. We stayed there two times, in 2010 and November 2011 and we chose it for its location. Rooms are clean but a little bit outdated. We took superior room with balcony and view on Ramblas and it was well worth it. Our firends took standard and were not that pleased. It was a good experience, though, and breakfast was great!
UR120308669	Perfectly situated on La Rambla and minutes from the first stop for the sight-seeing bus tours, the port, designer shops, Hard Rock Cafe - ideal. The rooms are well furnished, clean and tasteful and some have views over La Rambla; reception staff very pleasant and helpful and piano bar on Saturday nights. Decent choice at breakfast although the room seems a bit crowded some mornings and is perhaps a little small for 125 bedrooms. I have stayed there 3 times now and would happily stay there whenever I go back. Also near one of the most popular restaurants Los Caracoles (The Snail) just off La Rambla.
UR119517254	We had booked rooms against the courtyard, and we got it. And on the 7 th.floor! The hotel has a perfect location when you want to be on the Ramblas. The receptionist tried to get us connected to the Internet but very soon gave up with a "sorry". We slept there, and had a very good breakfast included. Other facilities we did not try. But early in the morning we had a beautiful sunrise on the balcony against La Sagrada Familia. In morning light even the huge crane and the scaffoldings was beautiful. But with the 24 hour noise on the Ramblas we were glad to be on the backside.
UR119435369	Wonderful room, spacious and comfortable. The room overlooked a lovely courtyard at the back of the hotel and was very quiet, even though the hotel was on the Ramblas,which made it a perfect postion for sightseeing. The breakfasts were terrific, so much choice and we ate so much that we hardly needed any lunch.
UR119405654	Great location, Nice hotel, Nice room overlooking the ramblas breafast was ok perhaps not worth 15E.Street noise dies down around 12am, it wasn't a problem. Reception staff were not professional and would be promtly ejected from an actual 4 star Hotel.
UR119031737	One night stop. kind personell, fresh impression, clean. Two buildings joint, in the older one was placed my Superior Room (#23). Large, elegant, with Veneziana window over La Rambla. Despite this is not my favourite area of Barcellona, as it has become a turists-carnival-catwalk, I immensly enjoyed my room. Nice table to work -with a view, quite effective noise reduction pannel, big chandelier hanging, nice olf furnitures and modern, fine bathroom. Breakfast was adequate for this category, wireless connection definitely good. Didn't visit the SPA. The hall is nothing special, but I suggest to judge the room first.
UR118978635	We had 3 days in August and found the hotel wonderful. The staff were friendly, rooms were neat, tidy and comfortable. We had a back room overlooking the court yard, which was lovely and quiet. We had Dinner in the restaurant a few times and the food was excellent. The breakfasts had plenty to choose from. Being right in the middle of the pedestrian plaza was great and having all the markets right outside the door were interesting. We found the hop on off bus a geat idea to see the sights, and a visit to Monseraat Monastery a wonderful experience. We would recommend this Hotel to those who want to be close to the action.
UR118908830	The rooms were very modern and clean. All the normal hotel stuff you usually see and more. Our room was overlooking the ramblas which was great. Best part was that with the window closed and the electronic sound blocking curtain meant a great nights sleep. The view was incredible if you're lucky enough to get a rooms facing the street. You can just sit and people watch all day long and see all the sights from your room when you get bored. Service at the front desk can get kind of slow though. Took us a little longer than necessary to check into our rooms or just grab an extra key.
UR118126928	We stayed here for 3 nights in August 2011 and we found the hotel to be in a great location . Centrally located in Los Ramblas which is the main street of the shops and attractions . The room was a little noisy but we slept with no problem , great sized room and very comfortable . The staff were very helpful and very friendly . Breakfast was good with all the usual buffet foods served . The street Los Ramblas never sleeps , great market stalls and music and entertainment , restaurants aplenty . I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again .
UR117021980	This hotel is right on the busy street Ramblas. It is very very convenient. However, it is a little noisy if you are facing the Ramblas street. Otherwise, it is ok. The decoration is modern. Food for the breakfast was ok, too. It is very closed to the Metro/subway, there's also a bus that can take you to the airport. The bus is very cheap, and it is near the subway station. If you travel light, it is a good idea to use that bus service. On the Ramblas, there are so much things to do. But the restaurant prices are expensive. In the alleys, you can find less expensive places. Because it is a busy hotel, the customer service is ok. But it is expected in this big busy street and city. I love Barcelona. I wouldn't mind going there again. Depends what you want, if you want convenience, this is the hotel. If you want quiet place, I don't suggest this one. If you can get a good price for it, staying in this hotel is not too bad either. Because it will save you a lot of time on transportation. Very centrally located.
UR116467500	Stayed at hotel rivoli ramblas for three nights! Was very disappointed with the service, beds, size of room and the fact that they advertise free wifi throughout; however there are certain rooms that do not get a signal! Was promised they would fix it, but it never happened. Good location if you want to be in the middle of a busy street with a lot to see! However it was loud at night and the wall were very thin! Would pick a different hotel next time! Happy travels
UR116239094	We found no faults at this charming hotel with very friendly and helpful staff . It's at the top end of the Rambla , a five minute walk from Catalunya "square" where the aeroport shuttle bus is , there is one leaving every ten minutes. We stayed three nights on the 7th floor in a room at the back , nice and peaceful with a lovely view of Barcelona from the balcony, watching the sun rise was a treat .
UR115957004	I was only in Barcelona for 2 days on a business trip, however the hotel that I stayed in could not have been more convenient and situated more central. Coming out of the hotel you are right on the Ramblas and only a few minutes walk away from the Placa Catalunya, and the main shopping area ( El Corte Ingles ), and going the other way down the Ramblas you end up by the port. The hotel itself was very clean, and the service from the staff very good. Breakfast had to be taken in the Sister hotel, but as that was just accross the street it was no problem. Reception was very well maintained as was the room. I found this to be an excellent choice.
UR115608969	This is a great little hotel. The location is perfect. Rooms are above average in this range of hotels, although the wall colour in our room was a bit odd - strange orange. This did not worry us though. Nice bar area with probably the best breakfast of all the hotels we stayed in.
UR115537317	the location is the best but the rooms are basic with a small extra cost it could have been a good room ie they tile the bathroom floor but still put a bath in wet rooms are now the thing plus tea and coffee facilitys in the room and it might have come close to being a 4 star plus in the dining room it would have been nice to be asked what you would like to have with your breakfast ie tea or coffee rather than having to ask for it every morning
UR115273862	Positive: Good location Negative: -Allocated to a disabled room when booked over 8 months ago. -Was told that breakfast was included to find out once finished breakfast that it was not included and we would have to pay a ridiculous amount to what the food was worth. Very average food. -When complained that we were false informed about breakfast we could not even get a SORRY just told "people make mistakes". -Asked hotel if we could have places to go to listen to some Spanish music and was to much of an effort for them to do. -Housekeeping walked into our room without even knocking. Overall: Would never recommend any Friends Family and Strangers to stay at this hotel there is alot more hotels in the CBD that I’m sure would have their staff properly trained in customer service. Was an average hotel with shocking services.
UR114909369	tiny rooms, but very good staff, very caring, and surprisingly decent restaurant
UR112617134	Hotel in a great situation on the Ramblas. All staff very nice especially the reception staff who were very helpful especially David. Nice selection of food for breakfast. Sun terrace on floor 7 worth checking out.
UR106876057	I booked (via a website) a reservation at Rivoli Ramblas for a tentative one-night stay in April. Upon further research, I found a different hotel and subsequently cancelled my stay with Rivoli back in January. Upon my return from my recent trip, I noticed that my bank account was debited $260 by Rivoli Ramblas for a stay that never happened. I tried numerous times to contact the Hotel via email and through the booking agent, and the hotel denies ever cancelling my stay. I have yet to receive any direct email or contact from the hotel, which leads me to believe that their policy is maybe unhappy patrons will simply disappear. Sorry Rivoli Ramblas, it doesn't work that way. I'm about ready to pursue legal action to recover my funds and would advise anyone considering them as a potential hotel to be weary of their tactics.
UR106837776	Rivoli Ramblas Hotel is located in the city centre close to everything including the central subway . The hotel is very trendy with interesting artwork inside. The room was small but nicely decorated with modern furnishings. The room I was given had a view of the fire escape but found out from other members of my group that those who had views were dealing with noise from the busy street below. The shower was not that great as there was no water pressure and the drain did not work very well. The hotel has free internet in the rooms which was pretty good. The only major issue I had with the hotel was the staff – as I did not feel safe. On several occasions I felt like the hotel staff were watching me and scanning my belongings. When the Porter brought my suitcase up to my room he left my bad in the open near the elevator and I only found it when I tried to find my bag. Other members of my tour group reported similar incidents and also felt unsafe in the hotel.
UR106151816	Excelent location. But the noise, the service and the water pression in the shower are not of a 4 star hotel
UR101773507	Location of the hotel was great, cannot complain. But with the good location comes the noise. Right next to the ramblas, there is no good night sleep. I was extremely tired, so the noise didnt bother me. But who wants a good night sleep, doesnt go there. The rooms are spacious, but definitely not worth a 4 star. It is fairly run-down and would need a make over. Room service was good and not too expensive. Service was friendly and helpful. Free Wifi was a positive aspect
UR98418848	Great location, but not a 4-star hotel. Unimressive rooms and service. Very very noisy location. If you want a good night sleep either ask for a room that does not overlook Las Ramblas or stay at a different hotel. Right across a Carrefour which might turn out to be very helpful.
UR97583575	The hotel was very good, the food (Breakfast was more then plenty and really tasty). You can have breakfast from 7am till 11am, and have it in your room till 11 am as well. The rooms were spacious and kept spotlessly by the cleaning maids, as with the the bathroom, towel's etc. Perfect location, for tour agencies, hop-on hop-off bus, Bike ride, all within walking distance, Taxi to the Airport from La Rambla 25 Euro. Carre Fore Supermarket across the road, you can buy anything. Downside You have to pay 2 Euro for using the safe key each day You have to pay 7 Euro for using the sauna
UR97493452	The location was great but the rooms were small, noisy and unimpressive. I rates at the most a low 3-star. Would probably not stay there again.
UR92348509	This hotel has a great location right off the Ramblas. The staff is very helpful speaks English. The food in the restaurant is outstanding. The rooms are a little small by American standards, but those with a balcony are to be recommended. Those used to American hotel rooms may be initially disappointed by the room size, but the location and staff make it a great place to stay. I would definitely stay there again
UR89765332	This hotel is very well located, right on "Las Ramblas". I was able to get a descent deal for a room, considering the location. At arrival, the front desk clerk did not have our booking information and gave us a hard time to get us our room. It was late, almost midnight, and we had to argue with the guy for a while before getting our room. The room was noisy, since it was right next to Las Ramblas. The hotel could have a better isolation. We were so tired that we went to sleep fast though. Other than that, the room was average for a 3 stars hotel. We did not use any other services from the hotel.
UR87523005	This hotel has an excellent location. It's in the heart of the city centre and is close to many tourist spots. However, the rooms are NOT soundproof so you can forget about sleeping as you can hear everything going on down in the street, especially the loud music on the weekends. So do take a pair of earplugs with you! The service was just ok and the breakfast was nothing great. Overall, not great value for money...
UR86670481	Our room was ready at 10:30AM. Free internet, roof terrace view, clean room, very nice and helpful stuff, but... I think it is not 4*. But.... you are in the central place and so close to Gothic quarter, La Booqueria, Metro stop, Marina, restaurants and shops and more. We spent 4 nights and it was great...
UR85207439	We had a great stay here in Barcelona for 5 days, the hotel was in the heart of all he tourist happenings on La Ramblas. Our room faced onto La Ramblas which while the door was open allowed you to see and hear the activities happen but when closed you had the tranquillity of quiet to sleep and rest. It was fabulous to be able to walk everywhere and not need buses or taxi's unless travelling great distances out of the city. Loved it so much I would stay there again.
UR84748263	We stayed at the Rivoli twice within a two week period. The first two-day stay was in a room overlooking the terrace - quiet and comfortable. The second stay was in a room on the street - painfully noisy until 3:00 AM. The accomodations are quite comfortable, but the showers leave something to be desired. The breakfast was adequate (not great) but the staff was cordial. Although we never dined at the hotel, we did frequent the lobby bar. The service is terrible! We actually had to go to the reception desk and ask the bartender to be paged. In general though, the staff is friendly and helpful. When traveling to either the cruise ship terminal or the airport, do not use one of the grey vans that are generally parked in front of the hotel. Although comfortable to travel in, they are two to three times the cost of a black and yellow cab.
UR83156926	A group of friends stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas for a couple of days before a cruise. We enjoyed our stay very much. Breakfast was very good. The location made it easy to get around and see the sights we were interested in. There was always plenty to do along the Ramblas. I'd read about the trains running beneath the hotel and was a little concerned, but even though we were on the floor one, I only noticed them once in the night and then it was just a very distant rumble. I'd stay at this hotel again on a return to Barcelona.
UR82717749	We stayed in the Rivoli Ramblas for 5 days and could not fault it. We had requested a room with a view but we did not receive this at booking in time. The room which was basic was cleaned every day to a very high standard. The breaffast/dining room was very airy and we never had a delay at breakfast time. There was a very good choice of foods for the breakfast. The hotel is ideally situated on the upper part of Las Ramblas just a few hundred yards from Placa de Catalunya. The Aerobus from the airport stops in that area so the hotel location is ideal. We would definitely stay at this when we do return to Barcelona.
UR82400258	Checked reviews of this hotel on this site, and most were favorable, but one must question the bad reviews, because we found no fault with this hotel at all. Check-in went smoothly, and they responded well to a request for a room at the rear of the hotel away from street noise. Room was clean, well-equipped and with free wi-fi. Food was good, the breakfasts excellent, and the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. So much so we booked in ten days later, to stay again. The location is good, right on La Ramblas, and there's good access to the Aerobus, and plenty of taxis. What's not to like?
UR78983935	I booked a standard room with my husband for our honeymoon. When we arrived we had been given a free upgrade to the honeymoon suite! A complimentary bottle of cava in an ice bucket with 2 glasses were waiting in our room for us! The suite was excellent and the view of La Rambla was amazing, we both really enjoyed people watching. We also had large doors/shutters which we closed at night and they really drowned out the noise and light. The location was perfect for us. The reception staff were great, their English was perfect and they were helpful and pleasant. The buffet breakfast (which was included in our stay) was fine. They also served breakfast until 11am which was ideal. I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to return.
UR76286011	The hotel is located directly on the Ramblas, near Plaza Catalunya, a few meters from "Catalunya" metro station and near several major bus lines. Almost all important sights are withing walking distance or at least a few metro stops away. We had a room overlooking the Rambals, 3rd floor, a little noisy during the day but good atmosphere all in all. If you prefer a quieter room ask for a room not facing the main street. Rooms are of good quality, television, good air conditioning, mini-bar which we didn't use, shower had a weak water flow but it didn't bother us too much. Our deal included a "Breakfast Buffet" which meant fresh orange-juice or mineral water, coffee/tea, fruits (pineapple, bananas, oranges, apples etc.) cheese buffet, meat buffet, eggs (scrambled and hard boiled), bacon, tomatoes, patesries and sweets. The best part was the staff, especially the reception crew who were absolutely charming, very helpful and answered every question we had about the hotel and the city (and we bothered them quite alot...), always in a polite and considerate manner. Rooms are held in the luggage room until your flight, even though "check-out" is at 12:00. I would definately recommend this hotels to any tourist looking to explore and enjoy the city of barcelona. People who are very strict about noise should ask for an inner room or go somewhere else, but everybody else would have a great time.
UR73495661	We went to Barcelona for a weekend and this hotel was in a great location, just down from the Plaza Catalunya where the Hop on Hop off buses leave from. Our room had a balcony overlooking La Rambla which meant it was a little noisy at night but it did have excellent air conditioning! We had a deal which included breakfast which was adequate. on check out day the staff were helpful and stored our bags until we needed them at no charge. We had a very pleasant stay.
UR68347634	this hotel has the best location in barcelona, on the most happening street, la rambla. the rooms are very modern and well spaced out and also well equipped. the staff is extremely helpful and the location is the best for both shopping and sightseeing in barcelona. the suites of the hotel are simply amazing.
UR63836418	This hotel has many things going for it. An excellent location in las Ramblas. It has free WiFi. The breakfast buffet is excellent. Do try to get a room facing inside because the ones facing Ramblas are very noisy. The only complaint I have is that some rooms have awful smell due to problems with sewage. Imagine being in a room that smells like your next to raw sewage. I had to open the windows to make the smell go away. And when I complained to the man in the front desk (a young guy, wish I could remember his name), his answer was "Yes, so what?". I am not kidding.
UR60332350	Clean hotel. The location was outstanding!!!! Can get noisy at nighttime if your room is on the street. We loved watching all of the action throughout the night. Paying extra for the hotel's breakfast was worth it.
UR58211950	My fiancee took me on a surprise to Barcelona, to see a Barcelona game [Im a big fan]. The city is beautiful, even when raining. The Tapas are incredible and the people are nice. I ordered my hotel on easyclicktravel.com. the hotel is located on the very toured "Ramblas" - next to the train, and walking distance from all Important places in Barcelona. HOtel was very comfortable, and gave us just what we needed on a place like Barcelona, where you are out all day. The spanish people are very generous about the stars they give to hotels [In other places it could have been 3 stars] but Barcelona is such a fun city that it doesnt matter.
UR57813472	I stayed 1 night in February with my husband. The Hotel is right in the city center, just one block from the Catalunya Park. During the check in (very fast), the Hotel offers a room with view to Ramblas Ave. or a quiet one without view. As we want to rest quietly, we choose the one without view. We didn’t pick the breakfast so I can’t comment about it. The standard room was spacious and the bathroom too. The check out was fast too. We book it with the flight. The price was really good. If you want a place to rest in a best location, near the sea, near the Barri Gotic, near the Pg da Gracia, I recommend this hotel.
UR57179444	we stayed in barc for 5 nights and after being in our room for 2 hours we couldn't stand the smell so we went out letting them know - they would sort it i was promised. dont know if they sprayed but it didnt go away and by the next morning i couldnt stand another minute there. it was the drains and they sent someone to fix it. this was a temp but not a perm solution. We returned later that day to find the smell had returned just as bad as it was and so asked to be moved. they accommodated us in another room which wasnt as nice but didtn smell. for this reason bad experience so rated poor for us. also no curtains so woke up early ok but def not up to the 4 stars promised. brekfast was the same level as Days inns - the same standard but with more variety. Food is dEf not anything you would really reccomend. overall disappointing
UR51743596	We ended our Cruise in Barcelona and stayed 4 nights at the Rivoli Ramblas Hotel. Nice surprise, they upgraded us to a Honeymoon suite on the first floor (one floor above the lobby). The suite had two spacious rooms, living room with TV and bedroom with TV and balcony which overlooked the Ramblas. The bathroom had a separate shower and a Jetted tub, a bidet and nice amenities which included robe and slippers. The view from the balcony could not have been any better, great views and lots of excitement.. Because of the time of year there was no air, only heat and if the doors were open it was noisy-with them shut it was fine .Breakfast was very good. Shops, restaurants, groceries, hop on bus, just steps away. Make sure you go down all the side streets on the same side of hotel for wonderful shops. Across the street we went to a Flamenco Opera show which was fantasic! We would highly recommend this hotel but cannot speak for their standard rooms inasmuch as we stayed in a suite.
UR51352224	I stayed here for 3 nights in November. Here are my main thoughts on this hotel: Excellent location Helpful staff Decent breakfast buffet Not a very modern hotel (could do with a refurb) Bathroom in room smelt v.badly of sewage. (Room 25) Room had excellent view of La Rambla and was great for people watching I would choose another hotel to stay at if I ever return to Barcelona but I would recomend this hotel to a friend.
UR49994201	We were booked to stay at the Rivola Ramblas Hotel in Barcelona for 4 nights. We only stayed 1 night. While the hotel is clean the room we had was in need of painting and general reburbishment. The room was beyond small. There was no room, other than the floor to put luggage. If you don't mind staying in a 1 or 2 star hotel this is the place for you. If you expect more stars than 2 don't stay at the Rivoli. The Le Meridian across the street is very nice and we enjoyed staying there for the other 3 nights.
UR49189838	Pleasant and good hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Large rooms with nice comfortable beds. Excellent central location with plenty of shopping. Very good value for money.
UR48892128	My wife and I stayed in this hotel as part of our 10th Wedding anniversary celebrations. This hotel is an ideal location to explore Barcelona. Staff very helpful, breakfast far better than most hotels we've stayed in. Couple of hints to potential guests: - We initially booked the 7th floor as the rooms have a terrace overlooking the Cathedral, please don't do this. The rooms on this floor are quite dated, small and the view is not that great. Above our room there was maintenance going on with the aircon. Once reported to reception we where upgraded to a 'superior room' on the first floor without hesitation. Our advice would be to book a superior room (or try the upgrade route!) - At the bar a Jack Daniels was €9.50 !! all other prices where what you would expect to pay. - Supermarket across the street with good wine from €3 a bottle :) - All other major Hotels (1898, Meridian etc.) are within 500 yards of this hotel. - Very few stores open on a Sunday (esp. the 12 floor retail giant 'el corte ingles') Overall, a good hotel for a short city break. J. Crawford, Northern Ireland, Nov 2009
UR48557343	Our first trip to Barcelona, we stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas for 3 nights, we had room 205 right on the Ramblas and after the reviews on this sight we expected it to be noisy, it was noisy but what a great vantage point and we wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else, after a couple of Sangrias on the Ramblas the noise didn't matter. The sights are amazing and we got in as many as we could, Sagrada Famillia, Guell Park, Mountjiuc, Mount Tibidabo, Barcelona Cathedral etc etc. We still need to visit again as there were lots we didn't get to do and see, the breakfast at the Rivoli was superb, eggs, bacon, fruit, coffee, tea, juice it really set us up for the day, the staff were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely stay here again on our next visit.
UR47415115	A nice clean hotel, and good location to everything, BUT unless you have a room high up there is a lot of noise from the Ramblas. I did feel uncomfortable walking up and down the ramblas at night, its the red light district, and drug dealing spot. Pick pocketing is also a problem here. This is part of Barcelona having lived there for 2 months you do become weary of this so stay vigilant. If looking for a hotel try stay away from the ramblas its over expensive and busy, there are better hotels and cheaper, which are just as easy to get too. Any questions please ask
UR46982538	We stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas for 3 nights at the start of a 2 week holiday in Spain and Portugal. The stay coincided with a major festival in Barcelona centred around Las Ramblas so the hotel was exceptionally noisy. Ear plugs were needed for sleep. Hotel is in an excellent location and close to all major sights. Breakfast was very good with a great choice of foods available. Wifi was freely available in the rooms but we had difficulties the whole time we were there as it continually dropped out and had to be reset by staff. The hotel advertises a sauna and jacuzzi but the room that these were in was kept locked and we were advised that we needed to contact reception to get it opened!
UR46906219	The hotel is situated on the central tourist attraction street of Barcelona - Rambla. Taking that into consideration we asked for a quiet room and got the one facing the cortyard. As a result - no street noise at all though still some noise from the corridors. The room itself was nice, I especially appreciated the black bathroom. Room service was very fast and decent. Breakfast OK (esp. croissants with chocolate). You will definitely appreciate the location (by the way Boqueria is just a few steps away ) of the hotel and as for Barcelona you just fall in love with it.
UR46173943	great location - walking distance to most attractions. We asked for a quit room and got one that is not forwarding the street however it was still noisy (on the first floor) and once we asked we moved to quit room (on the forth floor). However I don't think it is 4 star hotel. To me it worth 3 stars only. We paid 200EU which is over rated.
UR35069530	I went to Barcelona with two other friends & so requested a triple room. We booked via the hotel website & were surprised when it turned out £100 cheaper than what travel agents were offering. We were given a suite & the couch was replaced with a camp bed. The room was very modern & spacious, plenty of wardrobe space & suitable bathroom size. Balcony overlooked the terrace & what seemed like the terrace of another hotel but we only used it for drying our swimsuits! The only downside I can think of is that we could hear the generator. We were located on the 1st floor (room 102) & only at night could you hear anything, like a gentle humming. Not loud enough to complain about or request a room change though. While out there two of us were pickpocketedat the same time, & apart from taking our purses they took the safe AND room keys which were holding separately (in case this very thing happened!). Since the safe key had the room number on it & the room keys had the name of the hotel we were pretty worried someone would put two & two together & maybe try to get into the safe. As soon as we realised this though we called the hotel who were great. They went straight to our rooms to check the room (although three girls in one room, clothes & make-up everywhere isn't going to help much when looking to see if anyone's gone through your stuff!) They checked the safe was still locked. They had our safe key replaced by lunch the next day & meanwhile we used the hotel safe to keep our valuables in while we were out. Breakfast was pretty good. Not the best I've seen at a 4*, but more than enough to fill you up. There was fruit, cereals, hams & cheeses, eggs & bacon etc. I ordered a club sandwich one afternoon and the portion was huge, enough for two. The staff at reception were great too. In the room there was a book with info on where to go during day/night including restaurants, clubs etc. My friend & I took the book to reception to ask one of the younger staff members for recommendations & he was more than happy to help. He gave us names of places we would never had known about had we not asked. The hotel is located at the top end of La Rambla so it's literally a 1 minute walk from Playa Catalunya which was great for getting the tour bus & the aerobus.
UR33714414	We stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas for 2 nights after staying at the adjacent Continental hotel (which we loved) As it was my husbands 60th birthday i had booked this 4* hotel as a treat. We stayed on a half board basis which we enjoyed and had got very reasonable through Alpha rooms. Previous to arriving at the hotel i had e mailed and asked for a lovely room overlooking Las Ramblas. We arrived at the hotel and were quickly escorted to our room and what a suprise awaited us. They had very kindly upgraded us to a suite with its own large private balcony overlooking Las Ramblas. The room was superb with its own large jaccuzzi bath and a bed the size of my bedroom at home ha ha. We were very impressed as you can imagine. It certainly made our stay in Barcelona a memorable one. The evening dinner was very nice and the breakfast was scrumy smoked salmon and scrambled eggs for me. You couldnt go wrong with the choice. Thanks Rivoli Ramblas you made us feel a million dollars.
UR32699129	First and foremost...check a couple of different booking tools - like BookingBuddy.com, etc. Some offer a buffet breakfast for everyone in the room at no additional cost...others do not. Read carefully and save yourself a ton of money by snagging the free breakfast. Ok...after flying into Barcelona, rather than taking a pricey cab to the hotel, take the city bus that stops right outside the termainal door. Show the driver your destination - he'll confirm that you are on the correct bus. It'll drop you at Catalunya Square. You're less than one block from the hotel and the bus costs about 2 Euros - a cab will cost you about 30e's...and they are equally fast. The driver will gladly tell you when to get off the bus, but the square is so big and branded on nearby buildings, you can't mistake it. Now about the hotel.....This is a great property, centrally located at the upper end of Las Ramblas (a superb pedestrian boulevard). The people-watching couldn't be better. Especially on Sunday afternoons (family day)...everybody strolls Las Ramblas. The rooms are typically European small, and rather spartan, but immaculate. The lifts to the rooms are the size of microscopic phonebooths. No more than 2 people with one bag each. Claustrophobic (?) take the stairs. There are at least 14,721 restaurants right outside the door, but for breakfast - the Rivoli Breakfast Buffet can NOT be beat. Americans: Get a transformer from the front desk when you check in if you didn't bring your own. You'll need it and they have tons that are free to use. Ask for a upper floor room if you want to face Las Ramblas (kinda noisey on wknd night). If you're overlooking the garden restaurant any floor is ok. Very accommodating staff, and they have a free secure luggage drop if you arrive early, so you can get out and see the this great city without lugging your bags with you. Nice place - Great location - Excellent staff and breakfast! Take a city tour on a big red double deck bus. They leave from Catalunya Sq...right around the corner from the hotel.
UR32387818	Thanks to a privious review on trip advisor, we notified the agent that we were celebrating our anniversary. The hotel put us on the 6th Floor at the back of the hotel, which had a balcony and and extra large bed. This was excellent as the Ramblas parties on until the early hours of the morning and although we could still hear a little bit of the noise I would not have liked to be at the front of the hotel. The hotel itself was clean, our room was cleaned daily, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breasfast was buffet style with a good selection both hot and cold giving you a good start to the day. The only probelm we had was that we pre-booked our airport transfer with Resort Taxis.com back home and they did not turn up at the hotel to take us back to the airport. Thanks to the hotel porter who got us a taxis within 3 minutes and a lot cheaper. Still fighting for our money back. The hotel is right on the Ramblas which is in 300 yards of the open top buses which are well worth the 27 euros for the two day pass. It also only about 500 yards from the harbour area excellent for an evening stroll. No sign of pick pockets but keep all valuables back in the hotel safe and only took out enough money for that day in zipped pockets. An excellent city to visit and plenty to see we had four nights there and about covered everything along with some great food and wine.
UR32086870	This hotel is located at the top of Las Ramblas and is a gem! We had parking nearby so it was a close walk with our bags. Our room was large, clean and quiet. We requested a room in the back, and they were accommodating. We heard no noise and were able to close the electric blinds to sleep in during the morning. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We walked out the front door and were able to enjoy the excitement and energy of the Ramblas. Starbucks was nearby but enjoyed the local bakery/coffee shop next door. Our breakfast was very good with many choices and good coffee. The amenities, and location make this hotel a must for anyone visiting Barcelona who wants to be in the middle of the excitement of Barcelona. The only criticism I have is that it didn't have a workout room that could be used for more than one person at a time without reservations. I would love to stay here again.
UR32070212	This hotel is located right in the heart of LaRamblas - great location for all Barcelona attractions. Minutes from the Subway stop. Easy to get to from the airport. Rooms are clean and very roomy. We had 2 rooms - one Triple and one Double. Both rooms were very nice. Breakfast was included. Buffet had many items - very good and well worth the price. I would highly recommend this hotel. Staff spoke English. Our bags did not make it on our flight, and were dropped off at the hotel later that day. Staff was very helpful.
UR29226252	although via most major international websites i saw this hotel in the range of 300-400$ per night per couple, i reserved it through gulliver.co.il, an israely website for 398$ for the whole stay (3 nights), it was a third of the price from the rest and inc. breakfast! for that price the hotel is great! clean roomes (although i did find a small cocroach 1 morning, but the room was really clean), nice bath. what else do u need in barcelona?? the location is amazing, you can say the hotel is in the center of the center, amazing location!! i saw they charge about 20 euros for braekfast, while you can just step outside to one of the tens of coffie shops on the ramblas. i got an inside room (no window outside, just to the lobby), but i didnt change it because i heard that the noise from the street can be annoying at nioght and pretty loud. the only downsides were that the air-condition can only be set to 19 degrees or more and to volume control so it starts an shuts every 10 minutes with a big noise, and in the inside room like i got you really neet ventilation!! the second problem is that every morning at around 7 am the maids start to shut room doors amazinglly load and you cant really sleep, and that is really rude and carless attitude from the staff!! over all what i needed is a nice bath and bed in a good location when a get to my room at night after ive been out all day, for the price i paid it was great!
UR29196407	At the end of my third night here - a rush job with the Opera Liceu who booked me in so I've no idea what the rate was - quite high I would imagine! Let's do it quickly - +++location /breakfast (although the room is ludicrously crammed) ++ my room - at the back and quiet (wonderfully comfortable firm bed) but no attention to detail - light bulbs and bedside light off, shower falling off the wall, wifi intermittent - -+ I've been here three days and haven't had the room made up - as I work evenings I need to "rest" pm but I've been out both mornings 1000 - 1400 with the "make up room" sign on and it's not been done. It's OK but doesn't feel loved.
UR28533047	We looked around for ages to find a hotel that looked clean in a good location. Rivoli did not disapoint. This hotel is right in Ramblas. The service in the hotel was very good they even charged one of our phones. The check out is at 12 noon and they looked after our bags. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to be right in the centre of things.
UR27835978	Visited Barcelona for first time. Three couples in total. The Rivoli proved to be a great hotel. The location was spot on. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was top notch. The staff were really polite and helpful. Can't really think of anything bad to say...so I won't! If you were going to Barcelona...I'd recommend this hotel as a great place to stay. In terms of Barcelona itself...mmmmmmm. Not so sure. We had a great time due to the great company we were with...but Barcelona has too many people living and begging on the streets for my liking. No matter where you go...there are lots of homeless people. Spoils it because you don't really relax.
UR27510908	Stayed in this hotel at the end of March 2009, and had paid the extra to get a good location on La Rambla. Make no mistake, the location is unbeatable, and the hotel is really easy to get to if your use the Airport bus which takes you to Plaza de Catalunya, less than 5 minutes walk away. Really had expected an upbeat, classy hotel for the money I paid, but I don't think the Rivoli Ramblas could be described as that. The room was small and at the rear of the hotel, with a view of several pipes running up the wall of the adjoining building, about 3 metres away. And that was it for the view. I was pleased to see a spa-bath. Unfortunately the bath took about half an hour to run and several of the hoods of the spa jets were loose, which can make for a rather uncomfortable bathing experience. The loose ones had been left at the edge of the bath for the cleaner to see, and I returned later in the day to find that they had been replaced, and were still loose. Otherwise, the bathroom was clean, but dated. The other thing was the intense heat in the room. I mentioned it to reception as I couldn't seem to get the Aircon to operate, and was told that due to the time of year there was either heating available in the hotel, or aircon, and that was it. So the window got left open at night as otherwise the heat would have been intolerable. One reviewer described the hotel as little better than a travel lodge. In terms of the rooms, I would agree. Breakfast was quite good, fresh orange etc and plenty of meats and yogurts, fresh crioissants, so no problems to report there. In general I have stayed in much worse places that Las Ramblas. The staff were helpful enough and it is superbly located. The rooms just let it down a bit and really, for the money, one would have expected a bit more luxury and panache.
UR27045591	got bus immediatley outside the airport for 4,75 euros n dropped off literally 5 mins walk away, room was pretty much ready even though checked in an hour after 2pm, room was extremely spacious and clean, excellent large comfy bed,Thought is was going to be noisy in room at night but very quiet,Dissapointed as no tea and coffee in room,air con didnt work and when turned the spa bath on, the stench was absolutley rotten,the smell filled the the not only the bathroom but the bedroom, was really really bad like rotten eggs and gas.. horrible.good points are location and bed...
UR26940450	lovely clean hotel with a very large room overlooking the Ramblas.Thought it was going to be noisy,but the shutters in the room blocked the noise when shut. The location is excellent watching the street entertainers as they set up. The breakfast buffet we cant fault everythng you would want. TIP ; ask waitresses for fresh eggs cooked whichever way you like. Definately recommended. Nice to take a bottle of wine up to roof terrace early evening sitting in the sunshine. Cheap supermarket directly opposite to get water before your day trips. only negative comment is theres no tea/coffee making facilities in room, but can buy cheaply at pans company opposite. you'll love it!!!
UR26849638	I stayed in the Rivoli Ramblas last weekend. I was a bit apprehensive after reading negative reviews. I had book a superior room and requested a king size bed, balcony and early check in. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite on the 6th floor. The room was huge and so was the bed. We also had the balcony as requested. The only flaw in the ointment was that the jacuzzi bath did not work properly. The location is perfect, very close to the square where the tourist bus and shops are. Also not that far from the Irish pubs which were full of athmosphere due to the Rugby match on Saturday night. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel so I cant comment on that. There is a buffet breakfast available across the road for half the price. Also there is a grocery store and pharmacy opposite the hotel. It was my first trip to Barcelona and I can only say that I had a great time and will go back again.
UR26726684	I used to live on the outskirts of Barcelona when I worked as a rep on the Costa Brava. I had very fond memories of the city and wanted to share them with my new husband as he'd never been and we were in Spain to celebrate his birthday. I chose the hotel as I had origionally booked a 1 star in the same area but I changed my mind when I found I could have a 4* for the same price. It ticked all of the boxes for me but I took some advice that I had read on another review and it worked! I told them I wanted a nice room as it was my husband's birthaday and that I wanted a front facing room with a nice view. We were arriving late so my main criteria was that I wanted to be able to find the hotel easily after travelling and having not been to the city for 7 years I was pleasantly surprised. If you want to be based on the Ramla, I don't think there is a better hotel location wise. We got the airport bus into the city and from landing to checking in was probably only about 40 mins! We only had a short ammount of time in the city and I wanted to cram everything into less than 24 hours! La Rambla has got a little bit, shall we say, colourful, over the last few years. If you haven't been, don't expect any glamour! but I don't think that's why people go to Barcelona anyway. We got up early and went to the Boqueria as the hotel breakfast was extortionate. The boqueria is only 2 mins away, as is the port, the gothic quarter and the placa Cataluna. We took the Metro to Parc Guell which was only 20 mins away and it was absolutely stunning. We spent the rest of the day shopping and the hotel were happy to look after our bags for us. Back to the hotel itself, friendly staff, clean, well equiped with additional touches such as reading lights and remote control shutters on the windows that blocked out all of the noise from the street. This hotel also ticked boxes for me from a personal point of view, sometimes I like hotels that aren't part of big chains and feel personal, I like a bit of kitsch and I got it here with the murals on the walls of scenes from the city, and the aquatic scenes in the piano bar and also the crushed velvet bedspreads! Why do you need tea and coffe making facilities when you can go to the Boqueria for Churros! I cannot say a bad thing about this hotel.
UR25735177	I was concerned about what we would find after having read such mixed reviews - also it was not the hotel we had booked but we were 'bumped' about 4 weeks before departure by our travel company as our original hotel had 'unconfirmed' our previously confirmed booking which annoyed me no end. However, we found everything to be of a good standard, clean & the staff extremely helpful. On arrival the chap on the reception advised us the only room left with a double bed was an interior room & suggested an alternative twin-bedded room. We went for this, as it's not uncommon in continental hotels & the beds are usually together. I had seen on the website that there are two types of rooms - modern & 'classic' so I said we would take the twin if it was a modern room. A lady on the reception chipped in that it was a very nice room, so we accepted. We were very pleased with the room - clean, lots of wardrobe space, flat screen TV, great electronic blackout blinds. The whole thing had a very contemporary feel. The bathroom was a a bit odd - very futuristic metal finish with red worktop & tiling but great bath & shower. (The stainless steel basin looked great when cleaned but once you've washed your hands once it looks a real mess - probably not a good decision by the folks who chose the fittings). The safe was 2 Euros a day.The room overlooked a wooden terrace at the back of the hotel. Breakfast was included in our deal & was very pleasant - typical continental buffet but nicely set out & a nice atmosphere in the open plan restaurant. I wouldn't have paid separately for it though. We didn't sample the hot food so can't comment on that. There was free wireless connection which was a real bonus. My room key (magnetic strip type) kept not working & I had to go to reception several times thoughout our 4 day stay but they reset it each time with many apologies. We made a few enquiries at the desk while we were there about taxis, sending postcards etc & they were friendly, helpful & spoke extremely good English. The location is great - 2 mins walk from the aerobus stop at Placa Catalunya & we walked everywhere else. Only 10 mins walk to Port Vell & the backstreets fo Barri Gotic are literally around the corner. As we were 'upgraded' from our previous booking' I don't know what t would have cost if we'd booked directly so I can't comment on value for money but we had a very positive experience & would go back again.
UR24421555	On my trip to Barcelona my travel agent booked the Rivoli Hotel for me, and told me Las Ramblas was the area to stay in and this was a four star hotel. I walked into the hotel and the damp smell was the first turn off. The unfriendly people working at the front desk was the second. Then when we asked the gentleman behind the desk if they had a conceirage, because the lobby was so tiny there was not even room for one, he responded by saying he was the conceirage. Then we asked to upgrade our room after seeing how tiny the standard room was, only to be taken into a suite to find hairs in the bathtub, a toliet that would not flush, a $5 blow dryer, and that same overall damp smell. The employees were not accomodating at all. We immediately started to look for another hotel and right across the street found Le Meridan. Definitely a hotel worth staying at, with a staff and a conceirage that will bend over backwards for their guests. It was not even a major price difference. Overall, Las Ramblas is very centrally located but not the area I would stay in next time, it seemed to be on the lower class side out of all the areas in Barcelona I visited. I still fell in love with the city and cannot wait to go back, just do not stay at the Rivoli.
UR23787674	We spent one night at this hotel. It is directly on Las Ramblas. We had reserved a regular room and had asked for a balcony if possible. When we checked in they atomatically updated us to a larger room with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas because they were not full. This was at no extra charge. There was a sitting area on the inside balcony.(It was all windows to see out but it was indoors.) Las Ramblas was very lively with lots of people since it was a Friday night. I thought it would be noisy but they had pocket doors that shut off the balcony and you couldn't hear a thing. The staff was great. Very Friendly. The hotel was clean and very nice. It is right at the beginning near Pl Catalunya where there are shops and restaurants. We walked around the corner to the Hard Rock Cafe
UR23326569	I arrived at the hotel after a 15 minute ride from the airport at 9:30am. Much to my suprise my room was ready. The room was spacious with a flat screen multi channel tv. The bath large and had a nice kit. Towels were soft with a gant de bain. I had a garden room so there was not street noise. The location was excellent (Ramblas). I got tour bus tickets at the desk and it was a short walk to the bus stop. The tour bus line lets you on and off as often as you like at points of interest. Great restaurants are nearby.
UR23293990	We stayed here for a 4 night city break over New Year 2008/09 on room only basis. The location of the hotel is excellent, being on La Ramblas which is in the centre of the main tourist area and only a couple of hundred metres from the airport bus stop in Pl Catalunya. From the outside the hotel is very clean and well kept and this impression continued inside. Reception was efficient and the staff had a good command of English which is always a help. Our rooms were ground floor at the rear which meant that they were very quiet (La Ramblas is very noisy and I think that front facing rooms might suffer because of this). Being ground floor they also had small terraces which looked a bit claustrophobic but might be OK for a bit of shady peace in the summer. The rooms were fairly standard with twin beds, TV, minibar, bath/shower etc. (but no kettle!). Again these were well kept, clean and reasonably comfortable. We didn't eat in the hotel at all so I can't comment on the food but there are plenty of cafes and restuarants in the area (tip - don't eat in La Ramblas itself but go a couple of streets either side for much better value). The only down side I have for this hotel is that it is very expensive. We wanted a central hotel and accepted that we would have to pay a premium for this. Next time, now that I know my way around Barcelona, I would consider staying further out as the savings on hotel bills would (probably) more than cover bus/metro/taxi fares in and out.
UR20892791	Best location! Closest metro stop is only a few steps away. Restaurants and tapa bars surrond you. Carrefour Express is across the street as well as La Bouqueria. This by far was the most convenient. We stayed in a superior room on the 7th floor (708) that had a seating area and a balcony at the back of the hotel. Very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla. Bathroom was modern with chrome fixtures. Hardwood floors and automatic sun blocking window shades. Easy access to aerobus. Beware their elevators are tiny that only 2 people can fit. It's definately a thumbs up!!
UR20127472	We spent three nights at this hotel in September 2008, and thought it was great. Our room, a triple, was more like a suite with a bedroom and living room/daybed for the third guest. The decorations are very modern-black bathtub, brown velvet bedspreads--but cool and tasteful. The location of the hotel (on the nicer part of La Ramba) is very convenient, and as we had a room overlooking the courtyard, there was no problem with noise. Breakfast each morning had a large selection, including some hot foods (eggs, omlettes), and it was served outside in the charming garden. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
UR19681616	We were at the Rivoli Rambla three nights last week, and would stay there again. The location can't be beat, right on the Rambla, a two minute walk to the central square where buses leave for the AP every ten minutes or so. The room we were in faced onto the Courtyard, which we requested because it was so quiet. The rooms opening out to the Rambla are great for atmosphere, but believe me, Barcelona folk don't go to sleep at night, and the street noise is considerable. The room we were in was very well appointed, the bathroom great. The TV was minimal, to say the least, but it did bring in Sky News, and we weren't in the room that long, anyway. The breakfast was included in our deal, and was excellent. Not worth $30 bucks apiece, if we were paying extra for it, but what breakfast is? If breakfast is not included in your deal, there are lots of cheaper eating places around. BUT, Barcelona is expensive. I confess we ate at the McDonalds on the Rambla one evening, a McDonalds fish sandwich, fries and a coke, and the tab was $9 bucks APIECE. But this is a vote for the Rivoli Rambla, with a special note about the friendliness of the woman on the front desk.
UR19153103	Excuse the belated review! We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The room was a comfortable size and super-modern, with a flat screen TV, polished wooden floors, impressive attention to detail throughout and my personal favorite - remote control operated blinds (very cool!) It should be noted that there are two wings in the hotel, the modern wing and the traditional wing - I strongly suggest you opt for the modern rooms as traditional appeared to be a flowery way of saying in need of a refurb! You are right in the heart of it all here, with the infamous Las Ramblas on your doorstep - thus quality restuarants, bars and great shopping are never more than a stones throw away. Highly recommended for a short city break.
UR15048937	Just come back from a 4 night break in Barcelona staying at the Rivoli Ramblas. The hotel is a 4*. The room was ready on arrival and was very large with a huge balcony with table and chairs. The bathroom was also very big. The room was clean and had everything we needed. However, I did think that it was rather expensive at 120 euros per night, although I suppose you have to remember that this is in a city on the main street in Barcelona. The location was excellent - right on la Ramblas, so everything was nearby. The room was cleaned daily. We did not eat at the hotel as there as so many places to choose from nearby. We did get a coffee in the bar just before we were leaving and I must say that the bar man was incredibly rude - didn't say one word to us at all. The receptionists were helpful and friendly and spoke excellent English, which always helps when your Spanish is not great!! All in all, a good choice of hotel with a perfect location that is paid for with the room rates.
UR14982364	we requested interconnecting rooms, but when we arrived, they just gave us 2 adjacent rooms, service is very bad and poor. i requested for some extra hangers on 13:00 and hangers arrived 17:30, that is with me following up every hour, and they will just say "ora mismo senor". room cleaners are very slow and sloppy, we leave room at aroind 10 am, and sometimes go back late in the afternoon and the rooms hasn't been cleaned yet. when it was cleaned, all the new supply of toiletries are just dumped in a small basket near the sink. they will not even get the empty containers and the empty cardboard roll of toilet paper!! they are not even changing the beddings unless you tell them! the rooms are very hot too, because there is no airconditioning during an april month, so staying in your room for a siesta is impossible! and staying in a room facing the ramblas is very noisy. but you cannot close the windows because it will automatically turn on heater!! the electric window shades sometimes work, sometimes they dont. WiFi is free, but signal is very weak. so sometimes you cannot make a connection. most of the staff cannot even answer the most simplest of question or request. breakfast is ok but nothing great. even their scrambled eggs taste bad.all i can say is that they serve good coffee for breakfast.
UR13894422	Just got back from the Rivoli Ramblas, i stayed here for 3 nights, in a triple room. i had a nice time at the hotel, got checked in within 2 minutes and was impressed with the front desk staff, they were really helpful and had a good laugh! The room was great,i t wasnt huge but three people managed to stay init, for 3 nights and not fall out!! However the bathroom wasl one of the nicest ive ever seen, water was hot and shower very powerfull, so what more do you need. The location is fantastic literally 2 minutes walk from plaza catalunya, it did make it quite loud at night and in the mornin but not too much to keep you awake, unless you are a light sleeper!! To round up, if you want a great hotel at a great price, choose the rivoli ramblas, im definately going to again!
UR13789591	Great location to get around main attractions of Barcelona. Reception staff very helpful. Found room for 2 adults and 7 year old child quite cramped but functional. Down side is the noise level in hotel, not from traffic/street noise but walls very thin between rooms so if your a light sleeper be prepared to be woken early! Worth booking breakfast option. Found easyjet.hotels the cheapest site to book accommodation.
UR13736735	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights and it was one of the cleanest hotels I have ever been in. The rooms are spacious, the bed is a decent size for two and the rooms have electric window shades...very cute! A perfect location right near the metro station and right in the centre of town! I definately recommend it!
UR13422753	Myself and my Husband had a mid week break for our annniversary and it was worth spending that little bit extra for a nice hotel. The staff aren't very friendly but we found that staff in general in Barcelona aren't very friendly. The rooms are very spacious and the bed was really comfy. We chose to have a room at the front of the hotel and our room overlooked Las Ramblas. It was great to sit there in the morning watching the world pass by and the street entertainers setting up for the day, but it could be quite noisy at night as the bin men come round about midnight. The breakfast was really nice and loads of choice ranging from breads, pastries, cold meats, fresh fruit and juices but the hot food wasn't up to much and could be sat in the hot well for up to 4 hours. If you're planning a drinking weekend then make sure you take loads of money you can't get 2 drinks for less than 10 Euros. In one bar we paid nearly £5 for a bottle of Becks.
UR13086370	Got the hotel for 3 nights through a special deal at the beginning of December and it was fine but not amazing. Using the English hotel rating I would say 2/3 with a 3 star maximum. We were lucky to get a bigger room as the hotel wasn’t busy so think they swopped our room with a more spacious disabled room on the 2nd floor. Walking past all the other rooms being cleaned we noticed they were small and badly decorated. Room was clean, although furnishings a little tired, but the bathroom smelt musty like it had no ventilation or had not been used for months. A scented candle in the room sorted this out though. The beds were comfortable and rooms facing las ramblas are fairly noisy, so this will be worse in the height of summer. No tea/coffee facilities which meant you had to order drinks on room service which shut at 11pm. Reception staff were not very helpful and one was even asleep at the desk when we got in at midnight! My mine gripe was wanting to use the “fitness centre”. We were told no problem and they needed 3 hrs notice to heat the Jacuzzi. This was fine but when we got there the Jacuzzi was lukewarm and the fitness centre was just one cross trainer. Then they told me this would be €15 extra each as all guests pay for the centre. I think they get their 4 star out of providing fitness facilities, but one cross trainer does not a fitness centre make! All in all, it was ok, not great, but perfect location meant you could see past all the little things. Doubtful I would stay here again when there are other decent places.
UR13066743	9 girls went excellant hotel - brill breakfast - would highly recommend.
UR12544845	The hotel is very good situated for people who like walking around and seeing as much as possible. Renovated building, nice bar and restaurant, all kinds of stores, bars, restaurants, places of interest and metro station within 5 minutes walk. Everything you expect from a downtown central hotel. I would not advise it for women travelling alone, the area might make you feel just a little bit uncomfortable after dark, bag snatchers everywhere. Rooms, service and breakfast of ligh standards. If you are going to stay there, ask for an upper-floor room and at the back. Soundproofing is not so good - you can actually hear the next-door guest breething.
UR12430934	We stayed here for a 3 night break. The rates available on the internet varied greatly. Our room was a 'triple' (the largest on the floor plan), it consisted of two single beds and a sofa bed in the lounge area. The room (102) was located to the back of the hotel and had a balcony overlooking gardens. There was a very noisy air extraction fan (which ran intermittently day and night) from the kitchen on the floor below. The room was clean, had a safe (2 Euros a day), efficient blackout blinds, TV including CNN & Sky. The breakfast buffet was good (19 Euros if not included in your room rate). The hotel staff were efficient but not cheerful. The hotel is located on Ramblas just below Pl. Catalonia (tourist information, city tours and metro station). There is an ATM by the door and a Carrefour supermarket opposite.
UR11446013	Hotel is in a very good location, rooms are adequate (ours was large, but some of our group got SMALL rooms). We had a nice balcony on the back side of the hotel, and were happy with our room. Nice black out security shades in the rooms. The breakfast was more continental then a full breakfast, but was satisfactory. Walking distance to the Hard Rock, and shopping, as well as the night life of Ramblas is right out the front door. Great little deli next door, with good food and prices. There is a grocery store right across the street where you can buy your soda for your room. The staff weren't overly friendly, but they weren't rude either. I would recommend this hotel. Taxi's are easy to get, and a good price.
UR11284558	We checked the reviews for this hotel before booking and went ahead purely and simply for the location. We asked for and got a high floor at the rear and, boy! what a view. (Room 708) The room was on the 7th floor and had a balcony with a 180 degree view over the rooftops of Barcelona. Buffet breakfasts were excellent, hot with plenty of choice. Everything was within easy reach of Catalunya Square, which was only 200-300 yards away. Overall, a great base for Barcelona, can recommend with confidence.
UR10218887	The Hotel Rivoli Ramblas is just a 5 minute walk from the Aerobus bus stop at the Plaza Catalunya. Its directly opposite the Subway and its on the Ramblas. It couldn't be better situated for general sight seeing. The hotel itself was clean and tidy and our room was on the 1st floor at the rear of the hotel and was wonderfully quiet. The hotel staff were always helpful and attentive whenever we needed their assistance. The restaurant was only used by us for breakfast and it was very pleasant. We wouldnt have any reservations about using this hotel on our next visit to this fabulous city. Steve Dark
UR8727981	I found the staff at the reception very rude but the staff at the breakfast was very helpful & sweet. Though the location is excellent but the rudeness of the staff at the enterence puts you off..The rooms as shown in the pictures were not the same bit cramped..
UR8231090	We stayed in the hotel during July 2007. Location is just great - right in the center of everything - 2 minutes walk to the underground, a convenient supermarket across the street, many worthwhile sites in walking distance. Walking into the lobby may be a little dissapointing (I was fearing the worst), but luckily the first impression was quickly dispersed. We stayed in a standard room on the 3rd floor facing La Rambla, and it can get a little noisy at night. Rooms are fairly spacious and clean - cabinet storage space was somewhat limited. The breakfast buffet is nicely done (apart from the scrambled eggs) and has a varied selection - do try to get a table outside on the terrace. Hotel claims WiFi throughout, however I had to sit in the lobby in order to connect. All in all the hotel perfectly suited us (2 adults) for a week of sightseeing. 4 Stars for this Hotel are are a little overated though.
UR8030021	From the airport just a 3.90 euro fare on the Arobus every 6 minutes takes you directly to the Plaza Cataluna with just a 5 minute walk down La Ramblas on the left is the Hotel Rivoli Ramblas. It could not be simpler. We had a warm welcome, arriving just before 11pm and give a choice of rooms either on the 1st floor or the 6th. We choose the 6th. What a great choice, The room was more than spaciouse. A great bathroom with a jucuzzi, large wardrobes, a safe (2 euros per day for the key obtained at reception) and a mini fridge. The bed was a king size and very comfortable ( ask for room 607 on booking) and what a view from your own personal balcony right over the busy Rablas. The room was very quite even though the location was central. There were electrically operated black out blinds. There was no breakfast included and I felt the cost of it was expensive BUT just a couple of strides away from the hotel you could get english or continentaln breakfast at a very reasonable price. Pianio bar for drinks and coffee is set in the reception area but there are many bars and restaraunts to choose from within easy walking distance. The location of this hotel is fantastic, right in the middle of everything. The tour buses are just minutes away and well worth a trip to see all the main highlights in the city. Well worth a visit and highly recomended. A good 4 star right in the heart of the action. A liitle expensive but you have quality and location in a major city.
UR7432749	We had a great time during our stay at Rivoli Ramblas. For the price, you get a very reasonably sized room (I might even call it large, by European standards) that had tasteful, contemporary decor. The location is especially marvelous (right on Las Ramblas, close to Placa de Catalyuna and the airport buses)! We were not even bothered by any noise from the street (though we're from NYC). Room was clean and the only slight drawbacks are that (1) the hotel is actually two buildings connected together, such that one side of the hotel is a little inconvenient to get to (5-6 steps up/down once off the elevators) if you have heavy bags or a wheelchair and (2) you can hear the scraping of chairs against the floors both above and below your hotel room. But there aren't tons of people hanging out in the bar downstairs, so it was not a huge distraction for us during this stay. BATHROOM DETAILS: We had a gigantic tub, good water pressure in the shower (though no door or curtain, so that room can get a bit wet post-bathing), bidet, toilet and sink with large surface vanity area. ROOM DETAILS: Beds were reasonably sized (wide twins; our king bed was two wide twins pushed together), though there were not many blankets for a room that can get quite chilly with the AC running. There was a mini fridge and I think an electric kettle for tea would have made it perfect. Large windows that faced onto Las Ramblas with electronic shades for keeping out the noonday sun during siesta. I'd definitely stay here again the next time I visit Barcelona and would certainly recommend it for travellers who want a nice room without a high price tag. It is not a budget hotel nor is it a luxury hotel. And it is not faux-contemporary, either -- it is *actually* contemporary in some rooms and our room, one of the ones recently renovated, was great.
UR7286321	I stayed at this hotel for 3 days in July 2006, and am surprised by some of the reviews here. I had an excellent room overlooking Las Ramblas and was more than delighted with the hotel, the staff and the overall service. The room was spotless, the towels changed daily. Yes there was renovation work, the hotel is upgrading floor at a time, but the floor that was being worked on was closed off to residents, and there was no disruption whatsoever. We booked through our local independant travel agent who was able to secure us excellent rates. The internet is not always the cheapest or the most reliable way to book accommodation. The buffet breakfast was adequate. The reception and the bar areas are small, but this is an historic building in the heart of an historic city, so there is going to be limited space. Good quality hotel, with the three things that matter most of all: location, location, location! Would return here without hesitation.
UR7282879	After reading earlier reviews I was not overly confident of the hotel before arrival but this really was a 4 star in every respect, if not better. We had a family room, which was spacious and equipped with whirlpool bath, mini bar, safe, and balcony view over the Ramblas, and hotel staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. We did not use the terrace bar,gym or spa, which has an extra charge, though the area was more than sufficient. The piano bar in main reception was friendly and the bar staff were excellent with our six year old son. It did appear that the hotel had undergone refurbishment, all areas were extremely clean and tidy, very nice atmosphere and the breakfast, which was included in the price, was excellent. Location is just 100 metres from Placa Catalunya, a main line metro stop and all sight-seeing bus tours, and whilst there is very minor noise from the metro this does not disturb you in the day or night. When returning to Barcelona this hotel will be top of the list to return to, if you are planning a trip I would certainly recommend. Top Tip: Do not use the "Pizzeria Grill" restaurant opposite the hotel, probably the worst food I have ever had, and extremely over-priced, turn left out of the hotel and towards the end of Las Ramblas there are many good and varied restaurants!
UR6811725	This is a fair enough hotel to stay in. We got it at a discounted last minute price but it still cost around 120 euro per night for bed only Good location at the top of the Rambles with a supermarket immediately opposite to get orange, milk, snacks, etc. A conveniently placed fridge in the room keeps them fresh Breakfast and dinner prices very high The rooftop has a little area in which you can stretch out and enjoy the sun All in all, pretty average
UR6719048	We stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas for two days after doing a cruise of the med last year. We were more than happy with our room....was a fantastic size and we had a huge balcony/terrace on which we enjoyed breakfast in the morning. Bar was nice, although could have been a bit livelier.....we also dined at the restaurant in the hotel as a travel guide had recommended it, however, food was very dissapointing.....so would dine somewhere else. All in all had a lovely time at the Rivoli Ramblas and would definately recommend.
UR6576533	Warning for future travelers: Hotel is undergoing major interior construction causing dust and noise all day long and into the early evening. There was no mention of the construction when booking or when checking in. Our bathroom was covered in dust and seemed to not have been occupied in sometime and there was a peculiar smell throughout the room. Terrace had terrific view though, but room itself seemed quite dated.
UR6045316	Great location and the rooftop terrace had a nice view. At the bar, there was a piano, but no live piano music as advertised, which was why I had booked this particular hotel. Breakfast buffet was a big disappointment at 19 euros. Lobby had funky garbage smell. Room was just OK. Towels were good quality however. Overall, a very disappointing experience.
UR5423814	I stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas hotel during a 4 day hen weekend this summer. As a regular traveller, I've experienced many 4 and 5 star hotels and this one was more than adequate. The location was great, both for shopping and sightseeing or just soaking up the atmosphere of the Ramblas, you really get the feel of this great city! The breakfast buffet had a good selection and the service was reasonable, and the bar in the hotel was also quite reasosnable considering its location. The only downside was that during our stay the roof terrace and spa was out of action undergoing a refurbishment, but other thatn that, I had no complaints whatsoever! If your looking for good value for mony, in a great location, you can't go far wrong with this place, I would certainly reccomend this hotel, AND I would stay there again.
UR4722552	Stayed at the Rivoli Ramblas 16th - 19th March. I sometimes wonder how four star hotels are rated?, The first room we checked into was obviously in need of updating, and was quite small, did not have a particularly exciting view so I asked to be upgraded. We had to pay an extra 60 euros per night but it was well worth it, we had a junior suite with a huge bedroom, sitting room and a bathroom with a jacuzzi bath. However when our friends checked in the next day they had a lovely bedroom that was much more modern and plenty big enough, so its seems pot luck to be honest. Reception was polite but did not point out any of the hotels facilities, ie gym, sauna, restaurant etc. There is a cocktail bar, which is very reasonably priced however the bar staff were very ignorant. We asked the concierge to hail us a taxi and he told us it would be quicker to walk to placa cataluyna and get one ourselves. The Rivoli has a great central location, but attention to detail lets it down, have stayed at three stars on the Ramblas that were cheaper and just as nice.
UR4624764	Stayed three nights at the Rivoli Hotel in Barcelona. Right at the top of Las Ramblas this is a upmarket hotel but the staff are nowhere to be seen. No trips offered or info on attractions. Felt as tho' I was on the Marie Celeste! Luckily the Tourist Information Offices are very well staffed and informed and they speak lots of languages. BUT Barcelona is absolutely stunning. Gaudi was way ahead of his time and The Sagradi Familia Cathedral is an ongoing work in progress you will not believe! Having the Olympics in 1992 completely revamped the infrastructure of the City and apart from the grumpy staff in nearly every restaurant and shop - we had a fantastic time. There is so much to see and entry to all the museums is very reasonable. Buy a 2 day ticket for the Turistic Bus and you get money off vouchers for food and museum entry and the bus takes you to all the sights. Very impressed - 10/10!
UR4565833	We have just returned from a four night stay at the Rivoli Ramblas and had a great time. We booked a triple room, which always worries me as we never know until we arrive whether it will be a double room with a camp bed, etc.. The room was a great size and third bed was a sofa bed, which was perfect. We had a balcony and overlooked the Ramblas, which was fabulous. The room was spotless and there was a huge range of food to choose from at Breakfast. The bar was very relaxing in the evening and all the staff we spoke to were incredibly helpful. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. We were a family of three with an 11 year old but there were all ages staying in the hotel. We have stayed in Barcelona many times and thankfully always been lucky with our hotels - but I have to admit that the next time we go, I really would like to stay here again!
UR4461836	On arrival to the Rivoli Ramblas the location of the hotel is superb, and right amongst the shopping district. The staff were courteous and pleasant, and the surroundings were tidy and clean. Unfortunately, this came to an abrupt halt upon entering the room which was allocated to us on the 7th floor. Dull & dark colours in the room, which were not too pleasing on the eye. The bathroom only had a mixer shower from the bath taps, which wasn't even pressured so the water flow was slow. If you do not understand Spanish so good, then your only TV choices in English are Sky News & CNN. I too also experienced warm air only from the air-con. Prices for the mini-bar, and in room safe are not displayed, so be careful on what you drink and eat. There was also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, and so if you required tea or coffee you'd have to go to the hotel bar, and pay the local fees given. All facilities mentioned in brochure and on the website, were unavailable due to ongoing refurbishment. This would be your alarm clock in the morning at around 8AM with the constant drilling & Hammering taking place. On a plus side though, the room was cleaned everyday to a high standard, and bed sheets changed daily. Breakfast was appetising to say the least, and the presentation was laid out to satisfaction. On another day in the future and once all refurbishments have taken place, this hotel may meet the 4* grade it is supposed to be, but right now in my opinion I don't think it's there yet. Ohterwise for location to the shopping district, and transport facilities this venue is spot on.
UR4086750	Stayed at this hotel as part of a work recognition event for "top performers". Very good location on Las Ramblas, the centre for everything in Barca. Went at beginning of November, with temperature at 70 degrees F and after last couple of reviews would have to say pleasantly surprised. Room on mezzanie floor "0" was huge, with balcony, very clean and professional. No problems with smell and arrived for breakfast at one minute before closing which did not seem to cause a problem. Went on hop on/off open top bus on blue and red routes which really gave a flavour for what to see if staying 48 hours in Barca. 21 euro for two days and covered the Gaudi favourites, the Camp Neu, Park Guelle(sic), the Olympic stadium and the waterfront amongst a lot more. A lovely City, second time visitor and I need to return to see more with the family. Hotel was well worth a visit and although I did not pay the bill I would have to say that on the evidence of my one night stay I would return.
UR3995152	This hotel really is NOT worthy of the 4* rating! It is in a FAB location, which is the best thing about it. Oh, and the breakfast is amazing too!! The lobby is nice, but then - prepare for the rooms!! The rooms are awful, we were in triple rooms, which were basically a twin room with a sheet thrown over the settee. The sink was blocked (although, they did fix it upon request), the beds were small and uncomfortable, and the room was generally shabby. But, if you're looking for affordable accomodation with a great location, then go for it - just expect the worst from the rooms and you won't be disappointed!
UR3731524	Not recommended as a rated hotel - most blatant false advertising and overrated sewerage drenched hole in Spain. Smell of sewerage everywhere, unfriendly staff. Room very small and extremely small bathroom. Light fittings fell off, window broken, dirty curtins, noisy. Much better expected at £160 per night.
UR3704906	Stayed at the Rivoli during July. Check-in was easy and service has been great. Standard of room cleanliness was to a high standard with sheets and towels changed everyday. Some evenings the maid went in to turn the bed clothes back and leave choccies on the pillow ! Room we had was one of the newly refurbished and was lovely. Unfortunately the Spa and gym were out of use due to refurbishment, however we were encouraged to use the facilities at the sister hotel `The Ambassador` which again was a beautiful hotel. Members of our party arrived on different days and at different times but again check-in was welcoming and simple ! Very pleasant stay at the Rivoli and will certainly go there again.
UR3326811	As I suspected from reading other reviews, it's all down to which room you get, My wife and I got a great room (The Butterfly suite!) easily 4 star but my Sister and family got a pretty ropy room which I would call 2/3 star at best, my kids got something in between! Otherwise, we found reception very helpful, bar ok, piano player was there. Restaurant ok'ish but only 4 people in, but that reflects huge choice of eating places at much better prices all around you, breakfast way expensive - go out. Evening meal - go out, try Attic just 100 yards down the street, same side-excellent food and surroundings v.reasonable. Location - absolutely spot on, although can be noisy at night especially at weekends and high season.
UR3322516	2 adults + 2 teeagers, 29th Mar - 1st Apr 2005 - Read most of the reviews on this site so stayed for 3 nights expecting the worst! Pleasently suprised had 2 rooms with interconnecting door (not requested be very convenient) on the 1st floor. Find the rooms very clean also all showers etc were in working order! The Hotel has a very good location on La rambla, very close to the metro at Catyluna Placa & shopping areas etc, the rooms we had were at the front of the Hotel overlooking La Ramblas with its street statues etc & could be very entertaining to people watch etc. Found all staff at the hotel very helpful and encountered no problems with the booking, rooms etc. ON THE DOWNSIDE - Being situated on La Rambla means at night it is very noisy anybody who is a light sleeper will not like it, at all hours people are on La Rambla usually very drunk & noisey, street cleaning & bin collecting also takes place during the early hours, the metro can be heard & felt from the rooms every 2 mins (stops at midnight restarts at 5am). The breakfasts etc in the hotel are very good but vastly overpriced! go next door to a local tapas & get an even better breakfast/ snack/ coffee for a 1/4 of the price. For us Rivoli Ramblas was adequate and we would be tempted to use it again, but would probably go for somewhere quieter. As for the 4 star rating all we can say is they must have a different way of rating in Espania, this is 3 star tops. Barcelona is a wonderful city friendly etc, dont be afraid to book hotels away from the centre the transport system is superb and easy to use.
UR3315354	Good hotel, nice rooms and EXCELLENT location. Would stay there again.
UR2575553	This hotel brands itself as some kind of luxury Art Deco masterpiece when actually it's more like a tired and grubby 1 star Motel. The rooms were dark, pokey, and slightly smelly with grubby carpet and linens. The water came out of the shower rusty when we arrived, there was a hole in the bathroom ceiling, and the bed was uncomfortable to say the least. The breakfast at the hotel was extortionately expensive and rubbish. In short - an absolute dump! The only saving grace is the location which is perfect for exploring the beautiful city - but steer clear of the hotel - there are plenty of other options situated on La Ramblas.
UR126348278	Rude staff,not welcoming at all,ruined our weekend.
UR126035367	we booked 2 nights stay and was very disappointed with the hotel , room was very small with a tiny shower/ wc , more like you would find in a caravan , staff were unhelpful , i only asked for extra pillows but no joy , breakfast was very basic , tea /toast/cereals/ and juice.
UR125732980	I booked this place mainly for its price and reasonable reviews. Located in Pimlico and about 10 minutes' walk from the Victoria Station and various eateries and supermarkets, this bed and breakfast inn offered a simple continental breakfast and relatively comfortable bed. The wifi was not free but reasonably priced at 1 pound/24 hours, and you could use the internet for free on the computer in the reception area. The place was monitored by CCTV and the rooms were fairly clean although some of the blankets had some mysterious stains on them. This place was let down mainly by the very poorly designed open-plan shower/toilet which was extremely cramped with the toilet being right adjacent to the shower screen and no separating stall so that the shower water would run under the screen and right into the toilet floor, unless absorbed by a shower mat. There was also no light in the shower so one had to shower in the semi-darkness with only the lonely toilet bulb providing some feeble lighting. The shower pressure was good but the temperature was temperamental and I alternated between getting scalded and gasping in the cold when taking a shower. There was also no hairdryer, no jug to boil water and no helpful list of internal numbers and other hotel services. Also the new towels had a pungent food-like smell to them. I had no complaints about the staff although it appeared that some of the guests were not too happy with some of their pricing options. Overall this place was very basic and average, but if low cost and good location are paramount to you and you are desperate, then this hotel is tolerable.
UR123352901	Stayed here two nights. Not too far to walk from Pimlico tube. A very small "double" room, a pre-fab miniscule en-suite bathroom, but all clean and slept well at a good price for London (44 pounds per double per day). Used the Wifi which worked well in the room - cost one pound per day. Basic breakfast included. Manager was a bit offhand and not very welcoming, but other than that no real complaints.
UR120825534	The overall impression of this hotel was good. It is a tidy, little hotel for budget travellers on prime location near Victoria. The price/quality ration considering the location is good. The rooms were tidy and service was ok. Some minor things lacking though. There was not any kind of glasses or cups in the room, nor anything to boil tea. Ok, tea is not so necessary, but it would be nice to have at least a glass for drinking. Breakfast consisted of toast and cereals. Bacon and eggs would have been nice, but not necessary for this price. However another toaster would be nice, the queues were long while people were waiting to get their bread toasted and if one is in a hurry there is no time to get any warm toasts. I have been in a couple of other hotels in the same area, some which were better than this, and some much worse. So in the end this could be a good choice when staying in London.
UR118360723	This hotel is exactly what I expected it to be. We had a basement room which was booked as a double and there was actually also a single in there too. I'm not complaining as it gave us somewhere to put the bags. As a native Londoner I knew what to expect in terms of size and I have had the same in Rome, Madrid and Paris etc. The room was clean, the en-suite bathroom had a great shower, the bed was comfortable and the TV, although small, worked with a great picture from the bed. The reception was twenty four hour and we could leave our bags as long as we needed the next day. It's a short walk to the coach or train station which is why we booked it. The fact is you're in London and very central. When I stay in cities around the world the quality of my hotel room is always second to location because I'm there to see the city not to sit in my room and stare at the walls. I have one very important comment which nearly made me review this as very poor. Don't get reception to book a cab for you, take a black cab from outside there are plenty around or walk up to the station. The receptionist did us a favor of calling his friend to take us because he was reliable and fairly priced. What this means is they over charge you and the receptionist gets around 50% of your overpriced fare. I know this because from where I sat I could see the message on the drivers PDA which said he forgot to give the reception Â£10, our fare was Â£22.
UR117355875	this really was the worst of all dirty shabby B&B, s i have stayed at in london or any where else we are 4 guys working away from home in construction and are no way fussy !!! but our office book us in this place and when we arrived the guy took us half way down the street to some house which was a flea pit ... when we said we did not want to stay he just said will charge your credit card anyway horrible place run by horrible people ...DONT STAY THERE AND DONT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD NUMBER !!!
UR116482999	We got two en suite double rooms. The one my parents stayed in had a broken tv, but they were otherwise pleased with the room. We had issues with the heat, which was unbearable due to a lack of suitable ventilation. The sash window had a lock on it, but it was broken, which left us uneasy as the room was on the ground floor. We even returned once to find the maid had left the window wide open, which was necessary due to the heat, but concerning for our property nonetheless! The bed was made once a day, but the sheets and towels were changed every two. The room was otherwise clean. Personally I found the matress very hard for my comfort, but the rest of my family were fine. Breakfast was (the bad kind of) simple. The dining room was in the cellar and could only accomodate about 20 people and even then it was cramped. People would arrive to find no seating available and would queue in between the door area and serving table. The toaster had 4 slots and people would (again) queue to even get their bread toasted. All on all, the breakfast secnario left me mildly stressed and eating there was uncomfortable. I would advise visitors to arrive at 8 for breakfast to get a table as the breakfast is only served for an hour. We went there as soon as possible (at 8) and it reduced the stress and we had our breakfast with less waiting. We also brought our own cheese to put on the bread, the jam and butter is otherwise all that is made available by the hotel.
UR115114379	this review is for the colliers hotel but hey,i only went there for breakfast,any one thinking about going would be advised to ask if ,a ,what hotel will i be in,b,will the broken lamp,tv remote, window,curtains ,be extra,Â£60 a night in london is cheap but,but treating people like this,will only end in bad reveiws,this is mine.
UR114712927	unfriendly , unhelpful, ignorant staff, dirty, smelly hotel, room was like a cupboard, window didnt lock, would never ever suggest anybody stays hear, continental breakfast means cornflakes and toast which you have to make yourself, then sit in the cellar to eat it.
UR111612699	Stayed 3 nights and wished I was anywhere but there. Toilet leaked and towels were placed around it instead of fixing it! Not even a plastic mug in the bathroom.Towels were dirty as was the carpet. Breakfast was the meanest I have ever seen; a stack of white bread plus toaster, a choice of cornflakes or cornflakes, cracked cups and plates and coffee in an old sugar shaker. I was asked for the first night's payment in cash and paid for the other two nights up front! It felt like maximum payment for minimum outlay. Other hotels in the road looked more pleasant.
UR108796736	Was in London for a conference. I booked a single room, and was offered a single room that was OK initially. on my last day I when i came back around 12.00 am I was told that i've been moved into a different room. Then i was told that room is in a different hotel 2 min away. This room was a box of a box room. it had a bed that is 2 feet wide and about 5 feet tall and the room could barely contain the bed. that's how small it was. when confronted, the manager (like person) was so rude and offered a refund for me to leave right away. They apparently didn't have a single room vacant but still accepted my reservation. Please be aware when you book.
UR101087400	Arrived late at night only to be infomed that the second room we had booked was not available and our friends had to stay in a hotel about a mile away. The manager had an extremely bad attitude and was very unhelpful we stayed one night and were then transferred to another hotel. We were not impressed with the staff and received no co-operation from then only stories about some electrical faults or water problems very unprofessional to say the least.
UR99302386	Room was an outside cellar and wasn't the most comfortable (the heating, or lack of, being a major issue) but what do you expect for Â£23 a night? Considering that's the London financial equivalent to sharing a hostel room with fifteen or so people you could do so, so much worse. Granted I lost sleep anyway due to the lack of quilt provided but I'd rather that than a backpacker snoring in the bunk above me! I wanted somewhere central to drop my stuff off and sleep after a heavy a night out so this was ideal - I appreciate it won't be to those who want to stay in the room longer. Depends on your budget at the end of the day. Sink was in the room. Toilet and shower was shared with a few other. The WC room was so tiny it makes an airport toilet feel gigantic. You can literally have a shower and use the toilet at the same time - not that I tried to master that art or anything! Didn't bother with breakfast as there was a queue and the things on show didn't seem that appetising. Hotel staff friendly enough, offering to hold my bag free of charge and happily providing information on events and allowing free internet usage. Television and DVD facilities available, though the freeview signal is terrible and can only get a few clear channels. Phone signal could also be better. Would definitely stay again for the price and location.
UR97616524	Stayed at this hotel in February '11...wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid - about Â£55. However the room was nicely furnished with matching furniture, small flat screen TV. The room and bathroom were only small but were spotless. Can't comment on the breakfast as it was only served between 8am - 9am and I had a sleep in! Close by are some nice local shops and restaurants Would be happy to stay there again.
UR97333151	Ok - this is not a palace but we got a great price for this centrally located hotel. We were within walking distance of Victoria Train and Coach stations. The area itself is charming, beautiful buildings and parks etc and close to the Thanes. The room was small and if you were 'large' you might have trouble using the bathrooms facilities but we were ok. My only preference would have been if they had duvets on the bed not blankets as I personally did not like them so chose to sleep on top of the bed instead
UR93762030	The low room prices for this hotel definately make it an attractive option, however after reading other reviews I expected the worst. I was pleasantly suprised with this hotel, for the price you can't expect luxury but the room was clean, decent bed, small mounted t.v. and a small but sufficent shower with hot water and good water pressure, it's all you need to be comfortable. The man on reception was very polite and helpful. This hotel is perfect if you need cheap accommodation with the basics. Also good location. I would definately recommend this hotel
UR87331299	If you are on a low budget, it could be a good choice - good location, rooms are ok enough to spend the nights. Definetely not a spa hotel, you get small rooms, narrow staircase, the shower and toilet have a feeling reminiscent of airplanes, but we havent seen any bedbugs, mold, and alike that other reviews mentioned. Staff wasnt unfriendly rather they poorly understand English, i guess. Breakfast is simple, and you have to make your tea and toast, big business, hah?! All in all, we're pretty satisfied, it was ok for the price.
UR83574239	Worst hotel we have stayed in, unhelpful staff, bed not made, no fresh towels, breakfast not ready, breakfast poor choice, however location and shower were good
UR82729166	Summary: An ok hotel. Pay Â£55-67 for a double en-suite and you will be fine. I can't vouch for the single rooms with shared bathrooms - I guess they will be far worse. You do after all get what you pay for in London hotels. If you pay Â£20-Â£30 a night what do you expect? So ok, just stayed @ Colliers for 4 nights on a business trip. And having read the reviews on TA I was fearing the worst. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's actually pretty middling in terms of quality and cleanliness. But it's not without some issues. Good points : - The hotel has a nice enough reception and entrance (some marble steps no less..) and it looks like it has had some recent money spent on it for refurbishment. This is true of the carpets which are new all throughout the starways and certainly were in my room. Decor is in good state too. - If you (like me) get one of the en-suite rooms on the top floor you will have a nice newish bathroom that whilst small is totally adequate. - The beds were made every day, the bin emptied and the towels were clean and new. - The noise levels were low both outside as it's in a decent area in Victoria. - Local shops and pubs are plentiful and major public transport links (Rail/Bus/U-Grnd) are 200m's away. - Safety is good with smoke detectors and camera's and key cards for the rooms. Bad points: - There is clearly a bit of a problem with damp in the hotel stairways as the odour of damp is quite high and they have to have a window open in one of the landings to help diffuse it. This odour was also present a little bit in my room. - There was some dry paint flakes on the carpet (not sure where that came from), and some of the stairway woodwork needs a bit of TLC. - The breakfast (and the breakfast room) is the thing that lets the hotel down the most IMO. The breakfast is basic and poor and the room just is not big enough for all those wanting to use it especially as breakfast lasts for only for 1 hour. There is also some room for improvement in the cleanliness of the sideboards where the food is taken from. And the lady who 'supervises' breakfast spends most of her time talking on a mobile phone is some east european language!
UR72402862	Wow. Only a few minutes walk from Victoria stations and sites. Great. But thats where the positive points end i'm afraid. Arrived at the hotel to check in. Handed over our details and the guy couldn't find us on the check in list despite us pointing our names out on it 4 time over. Then we discovered our room was not ready for another 3 hours despite us paying extra for an early check in via the internet. So we left our bags in an non-secure room. Our room was clean enough and the only faults were a leaking toilet that was letting water out at the seal around the base and a flip-bin that was broken and would not open despite my efforts. The room was absolutely tiny as was the en-suite but hey it's London so not that much of a concern. Bed was incredibly uncomfortable and due to being on a main street we were woken up by several incidents involving police cars screaming by with sirens blaring out. Had about 2 hours sleep in the end. Not the hotels fault but at least we had a refreshing continental breakfast to look forward to. Continental meaning a corn flakes dispenser and toast/morrisons 20p flimsy bread. The tea was rank, the milk was off and the orange juice which is dispensed by two ladies guarding the kitchen area was disgusting. We had to go elsewhere for breakfast and the breakfast room was tiny and did not accommodate for the number of guests. We also had to clean dow the table from the previous users as the 2 ladies who run the kitchen were to busy having a chat. In the end we were just glad to get out of there. Its really a hostel with hotel prices.
UR60237806	Stayed here for 3days after I came back from europe. Don't get me wrong the hotel is more nicer than other hotels but it is not worth the money we paid for. We paid 55 pounds per night for a room with bathroom and shower. Our room was so narrow and small that you have to close the room door to get into the bathroom. Whoever cleaned the room DIDNT....they literally just threw the covers of the blankets on it and didn't even vaccum the room. The bathroom had the shower and toilet in AND the shower didnt have a shower curtain in which everything got wet especially the toilet paper (I already asked the management for the curtain in which they told me.."but you have more space in the shower without one"). The hall and corridor down to the breakfast rooms smelt so old and damp. the breakfast was the basic cereal, toast etc. the internet was crap and you had to pay for it. Will not be staying here again. You can get better value somewhere else and you need it in a place like london. I'm from nz where every cent counts and 1GBP is equal to 3NZ dollars.
UR58230478	Nasty, nasty, nasty, stained sheets, horrible and unhelpful staff. Shower donâ€™t work, and the water was cold. Please any other hotel in Victoria but not this one. I go over on business all the time and stay in Victoria, but will never stay with them again.
UR39380175	Poor service, dirty and dangerous (ancient electrical wires hanging everywhere, old socketsâ€¦). This hotel is a trap for people who wish to find a cheap basic London hotel by internet. It seems that all their clients reserve/pay for their stay in advance by internet. So, when they stick you in a miniscule, dirty room looking onto the street with a large window that cannot shut, you are stuck. They were supposedly constructing a bathroom on our floor while we were there, i.e., the renovations are being funded by the client who suffers from (1) the noise of the construction beginning very early in the morning; and (2) the fact of having to go to a toilet/shower 2 stories below. Read the rest of the commentaries on this site for more. Thanks again to the Internet and client feedback. I regret not having consulted this before!
UR37482754	Totally filthy. Walked in, paid for the night and then was shown my room. I put down my bags and immediately went back out to see if the other hotels on the street had vacancies. Shared toilet and bathroom, very poor security, pretty sure my room was actually an old drain in a thin coat of plaster. Smelt like it, too.
UR37368502	I picked this hotel because of the location, it's a short walk from everywhere. the price was very ok. the breakfast was just breakfast. the bread and marmelad and tea were ok, but coffe and oringe juice were awfull. usually we had coffe and some food a later somewhere. The room was basically only two beds and a basin. Toilet and shower where shared with the rest of the hotel. it was not so bad. the sheets were clean:)
UR33261540	The room was basic compared with price. The breakfast was very good. Good location and calm. The staff was friendly.
UR31040611	booked a single room for one evening whilst in london, the room dirty,there were bare hot pipes running up wall and across ceiling one of which was hangiung down, carpet was dirty and not fitted to room, the shared toilet, yes shared was also dirty , dry rot running up wall and the shower head was alive with dirt and also had toilet paper around it. I have photos of it all, breakfast in the morning , well it was all self service and I mean everything , that was your cerial, yes that was all you got, will never use again, will never reccomend and will be reporting this hotel to the relevant people.
UR23750428	I picked this hotel because of the location, it's a short walk from Victoria station which is a main hub for major sightseeing. It's a short walk until you reach Buckingham Palace and onto St. James Park and so on. The residential street was nice and felt very "English". As far as the hotel itself: it served its main purpose which was sleep. This is not a luxury stay by any means but for those who are low-maintenance it shouldn't be a problem. Breakfast is served in the morning and it's a simple one of cornflakes, toast, coffee and juice. When I was there it was deathly silent in the eating room and the women who were serving didn't look very happy to be alive! The room I stayed in was a no-frills double that had a wet spot on the floor. It was one of the more basic places I've stayed in, but it wasn't a problem considering I just used it for sleep. Romantic getaway this is not!
UR23222396	We stay in colliers hotel just for 1 night & its bad experience but compare to price its ok start with t.v.in the room just 2 channels were working & just 2 bathrooms are there in whole hotel & there were many rooms sharing it..I think you need a sense of humour to visit this place. It's fine but it's not a hotel. It's a strange b&b that is cheap enough by London standards breakfast room was nice but in morning 7.45 we went to have breakfast we see reception boy & room cleaner girl kissing each other although we don't mind might be they were couple but just they told us to come at 8'oclock for beakfast. & since breakfast timing is 8-9 so that's fine with us atlast we want cab which they help us.I think you get what you pay for. Overall it was satisfactory.
UR23025571	We where staying at this hotel since we wanted a budget one and I guess we got what we where paying for. The room was basically only two beds and a basin. Toilet and shower where shared with the rest of the hotel. The sound isolation was very poor and you could hear anything going on in the nearest room and out on the street. The breakfast was ok considering the hotel standard although it only includes cereals and white bread. The staff where friendly and the location is excellent but all in all do I think that you could get a nicer hotel for the same money down the road.
UR21878645	We had stay in this hotel & found it all right since when we check in around mid-day time reception staff help us for our luggage room were small but clean & comfortable.Breakfast was simple but in that price its well & good.At last they help us by giving adapter,iron,hair dryer its really I appreciate.We will go back to this hotel in near future.
UR21398422	Me and my husband booked Colliers a month before going to London. We recived confirmation by email and I called them twice to confirm our booking. They ensured me that everything is booked. When we arrived they told us that the room we booked is not available.They cancelled our booking. Very rude man (with disgusting long nails) from the "reception" (the hole in a wall) told us that he sent us an email YESTERDAY!!! We were furious, because we have not received any emial, especially 1 day before coming to London. We checked mailbox in front of him and of course there was nothing form Colliers. He showed us his screen and he sent an email but to HIMSELF!!! Can you believe? It was unbelievable, we were so angry. We ended up trying to find some hotel ad-hoc, it was bank holiday and it was very hard to find something. I do not recommend this B&B, very shabby place with rude, damp, unproffesional service. Don't ruin your stay in this busy and attractive city. Renata from Dublin.
UR18384207	There were 4 of us, 3 adults and a 3-year-old child. I booked an en suite room in Colliers for 3 nights. However upon arrival, I was told that I wouldn't get an en suite room for the first night (Apparently, my room was taken!). People with babies will understand how inconvenient things were for us! When we tried to open the door, something was stopping us. There was a bed which prevented it to be fully opened! They must have added another bed to our room when our original room was taken! Talking about professionalism, tsk tsk. When we entered the room, we were shocked by the condition of it. It was...beyond description! Everything was wrongly positioned (because the additional bed wasn't mean to be there!). The cupboard was placed right in front of the basin, which means that we had to stand next to the basin when using it, tilting forward if we needed the mirror! Not only that, the window was broken and we were on ground floor! People could just jump in and say hi (I wouldn't complain if it was Brad Pitt, tho). We knew it was a budget hotel, but it didn't have to be that bad to reflect the price? lol. Initially, we wanted to tell them that we didn't want to stay for the remaining 2 nights but I was sooo paranoid that he was gonna kill us or something that night so we left it till tomorrow! I called them to cancel our booking but they got so mad!!! They raised their voice and said that I should have told them the day before if we knew we didn't want it. And my reply was, they should have told us that they couldn't provide us an en suite room for 3 nights before we arrived! They breached the terms of the contract! And they didn't know what to say and hung up. I tried to call back but there was no answer. The nx time I travel, I won't mind forking out a lil' more. =)
UR18360543	This hotel bills itself as "the ultimate in comfortable" but it falls far short of meeting the mark. While it is clean and in a convenient location (very near Victoria Station), and is reasonably inexpensive for the area, we experienced many problems. Upon arrival the evening manager was in the process of yelling at a young couple who were simply complaining that they had paid for a double bed and were given a single. Literally -- his voice was raised far beyond comfort level and they were being told to leave (without a refund) if they didn't like it. We had booked 5 nights and were told (in a much more polite tone) that if our travel plans changed, we were not entitled to the advertised three-day cancellation notice because we had booked online. We were given the option of paying for the 5 nights in full or leaving then and there. There is no lift (a minor inconvenience unless you have bad knees); the bathroom was so small that you couldn't use the toilet with the door shut; the shower wavered between too hot and too cold, with a few seconds between where you could actually stand under it; the bathroom fan vented the steam directly into the room; the furniture was a couple of plywood desks and a wobbly wardrobe, which took up so much of the limited floor space that you could barely get around the bed; the telephone only allowed incoming calls (you couldn't call out even with a calling card -- in fact, you couldn't even call down to the front desk!); and on our third night the building fire alarm went off repeatedly from 10pm to 5am, every half hour or so. In the morning when we asked for either a refund for the night of no sleep or to be let out of our 5-day obligation, we were literally yelled at and told that refunds were impossible. Another guest who joined in our conversation was insulted by the manager and told to leave the premises. Note: Neither we nor the other guests we observed approached these requests as demands. We were all quite polite, but were not treated with reciprocal civility. (On a happier note, after putting on a sappy-sweet and overly understanding composure, I was successful in getting out of the last two nights' contract.) In summary, if you're looking for a reasonably priced place right in the heart of town, and you don't mind some serious inconveniences, this place might be alright -- but beware of doing anything to set off the volatile employees/managers.
UR17338027	I paid so low price that i can't ask more. Yes, hotel was a little filthy but breakfast was good and bed was clean and comfortable. Situation is also very good. So if you need ONLY place to sleep and something to eat before leaving to sight-seeing, Colliers is ok. Oh, and the shower worked properly and it was clean also. I booked from travelstay.com where the price was very low then.
UR16553475	The place was really.. REALLY filthy. Not at all as nice as presented on their web site. We had two rooms, one on ground floor that was allmost new and quite ok. But the one on top floor with wc in hall was like in a horror movie. That wc has probably never been cleaned. Lots and lots of DNA - if you know what i mean. The wall-to-wall carpets are a focus of diseases, and the bed covers as well. I'm allmost 100% certain of that the bug bites and my allergic reaction two days after staying there, came from the bed in Colliers "Horror" Hotel. The only really good thing was the man that seemed to work 24/7. He was so kind and service minded, that i felt sorry for him. He even wrote us a map, and gave us good tips about best way to see London. The sad part is that it's really hard to find a clean B&B/Budget hotel in London. WHY?!! I some times seriously wonder if all english people are as dirty and unhealthy as their small hotels.
UR13685851	It was hell on earth. Everything about it was hell, we had a 19 month old baby travelling with us, I booked ths hotel in August and emailed the hotel twice asking them if they would have a travel cot available for us and we would pay the extra charge etc, they never answered my emails and now I know why. When we booked in we asked for the cot and were told to go out and buy one at a shop down the road!!!! We were then given a basement room and our baby had to sleep in our bed with us, there was no headboard on the bed and the back of the bed was not against a wall with the result that our child fell out of bed one night!!! My blood is boiling as I type this because of the danger of that room, we had to go down two flights of stairs with a pram to get to the room and then there was 2 foot of space on one side of the bed to walk through the room! There was a steep step into the bathroom which again caused problems with a young child. The stairs were failing apart as I was walking on one step it fell right through!! The next day it was repaired with staples!! The room was so filithy and disgusting, the pillows were dark brown with stains! We were freezing, the breakfast was disgracefull, we were there for 4 night and not once were our 2 towels changed, there was 1 tv channel on the tellie! I have been in many hotels around the world and I have never come across anything like this, I could write a book on the place it was so bad, in fact I am going to fill in every review I can find to warn people about this place..please do not alow anyone else to stay here, it is beyond words how bad it is. In case you are wondering why we stayed there, well it was because we had no choice, we walked to 9 neighbouring b&b's and hotels and all were booked out as it was the bank holiday weekend. The rate for the hotel is cheap but for gods sake they would want to pay people to stay there instead of the other way around. And when we booked in they tried telling us that the price was 190 instead of 160, we had to take out our print out from booking.com to correct them. The site is very easy to use however I think you should remove this hotel from your website as it is horiffic, dirty, filthy, the worst I have ever stayed in, can'nt believe a hotel can be so disgusting
UR13147048	I booked this Hotel(if you can call it that) for my partner, myself, son and his girlfriend for a two night stay, boy how I wished I had'nt. When we arrived our train was late which made us late on arrivign at our Hotel,we only had time to check in put our case in our rabbit hutch and rush tothe theatre. On arrival the receptionist was in a tiny room full of smoke and informed us our rooms were in the basement. The stairs were very narrow, the rooms were dull, dirty and draughty, although the sheets were cleen, the rest of bedding was disgusting. We would have tried to find somewhere else to stay but did not have enough time. Breakfast, well that was a joke, dirty tables, none of the staff spoke to us, crockery dirty and cornflakes already poured in a bowl, no choice, toast which was almost toasted and boiled water to pour on the tea bag which was in a dish with butter and jam, once again dirty, the floor was dirty and the carpets in the rooms needed agood hoovering. The box in which the shower and toilet was situated was tiny and a huge step up to get in. I know it was in the cheaper stay section but really it should be clean. A warning to others don't be taken in by photographs and description, you'll be sorrrrry. Rating out of ten minus one.
UR8268197	READ THE TITLE- yes as outragious as it may sound, THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR OWN BOOKING... I booked through their own website 4 months in advance, receiving an email saying everything is ok.. just a week prior to my visit, I get an e mail saying my booking has been cancelled owing to the fact that the credit card I gave them had been declined. To cut a long story short, my credit card has a $5,000 limit.. bank assured me they never had any request for debiting of funds from this hotel, and hotel never advised me anyway, even though booking had been made 4 months in advance - plus advising me when I was already on the road ONLY 7 DAYS BEFORE ARRIVAL! No use arguing with them as they said they had no room: threatened them they had to pay for the difference in costs of new hotel, all the tran continental phone calls and all that crap.. but what's the use.. seems a foreign customer has no legal rights in the UK so stuff it, or just one night and an extra 150$ cost is not worth the legal fees.. BUT BE WARNED!!!! Don't say you haven't been told.
UR6320305	Stayed here on two evenings. Firstly the hotel had very little working lights/bulbs. The rooms were not very clean. We were also put in a top floor room with a young child and the hotel has no lift and there were lots of steps up to the top floor. The toilet outside our room was in a tiny little cupboard that you couldnt even turn around in. Also we had not booked ensuite facilities so did not expect to get them however there was a shower and sink in the room which had bare wires hanging out of them not exactly good health safety. Now as I said we stayed here on two evenings over a week and the second time we did think of cancelling but as we were out of the country the days in between it wasnt really practical for us to do so. The hotel advertise cooked breakfast but what you get is egg on toast. Also the dinning room was not big enough for the number of guests that the hotel can accommadate. Which meant when we came down to breakfast we couldnt all sit together and the child who was only 3 at the time ended up sitting on my mums knee. The only things I would say that this hotel had going for it were it was centrally located and was near main bus and rail links. Sparkie
UR5709903	We just stayed overnight to be near to the Victoria tube station in order to catch a flight out of Gatwick the next morning. Our experience is similar to other reviews: the place reeks of smoke including our supposedly non-smoking room and the bedspreads are stained. It was okay for the few hours we were there but wouldn't recommend it to anyone else!
UR5543035	The place is not that bad as some people have written! Sure it's quite messy or badly cleaned but so has every cheap hotel that I've visited in London been. Also our room was quite worn out also as most cheap hotel rooms are. Beds were good and extremely wide. Our room had a private shower and the room was "cleaned" and beds made on both days that we were there. Breakfast was also ok, some corn flakes, cooked eggs and toast with jam or butter also tea or instant coffee.
UR5028274	i had a really bad expereince, which you can say that i stayed in hell for couple of nights, when we arrived in the hotel we found receiption room like a junk yard and person lying on the chair was full with cig: smoke, first i thought i am in some where in third world, after that he asked our name and told us that he has nt got our name booking register after providing the "print out" of our reservation he denied to give us a room because they have no availablity in the hotel and asked us to accomodate our self in other hotel, but after huge argument he ready to give us a room which i can not explain wht it was i never saw that kind of disgusting room and poor service in my life, but did not have any choice because all other hotel was fully booked. so i am giving you an advice stay away from this hotel, better to sleep on footpath but not in this hotel.
UR126420872	I got a nice deal on InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel through Hotwire, where you just know key details such as area and star rating before the booking (and payment) is done. I was happy to register that my hotel was the 5-star IC London Park Lane Hotel. The location is excellent, and Hyde Park Corner tube station (Piccadilly line) is located only a five minute walk away through subways. This mean you easily can reach Heathrow airport without changing means of transport and Green Park, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square in respectively 1, 2 and 3 stops. At the same time, Green Park and Hyde Park is located only a few steps away, offering recreation and rest from the city larm. In my opinion, this area is the best to stay in when you head to London for a weekend trip as a tourist. The service is excellent, already from the first step into the hotel, when from you meet the porter in the entrance, helping you with for instance your luggage. The check-in was smooth and the concierge was very helpful and professional. The room was up to date and had a convenient size, even if it was a standard room. The bed offered a good night sleep, and turndown service was provided in the evening. All in all, a great hotel, especially if you get a nice deal on the price.
UR126379300	This was my second visit to the hotel and it has become one of my favourite hotels. The location is next to Hyde Park and close to both Knightsbridge and Bond Street. The rooms are beautifully appointed and very comfortable. Despite its location the noise from the traffic is non-existent. The breakfast offering is huge and they serve both continental and full English. Many dishes are cooked to order so always piping hot and not dried up like you get in many of the large chain hotels. The breakfasts are expensive - I had porridge which was £8.00 but frankly I didn't mind this as the service was good and the view out of the window across to the park on a sunny Spring day was great. The concierge service is good and they will do anything for you. I will be returning in the future.
UR126303775	Stayed at the IC, Park Lane in early February. I was quite hesitant prior to booking, as it is a business hotel. However, as I was to be in London for just 3 nights I decided to book at the IC regardless. Boy! Was I glad! Being an InterContinental Ambassador member, I was offered check-in at a separate desk, by a "TEAM" of staff and was automatically given an upgrade to the much more spacious Executive Suite. Extra large parcels that were needed to be packed away in storage, were swiftly moved to their allocated locations. The modern, yet very inviting interiors and decor of the lobby and lounges were the ultimate contrast to the bustle of the city. The hotel is in excellent condition and there are plans for future modernisation of the entrance area. It is apparent that service is the foremost priority at the hotel, with a member of staff at each corner waiting to assist you with your every need. The rooms were gorgeously decorated. The hues of dark blue, greys, metallics and cream created the perfect environment for both business and pleasure-seeking travellers.The rooms are as majority of other London rooms- not very large. That is acceptable, and the IC excels as its configuration of the rooms are sublime. The beds are extremely comfortable, traffic noise (even facing Park Lane) is minimal, the electronic conveniences are all apparent and are of the best quality- this culminates in one of the most enjoyable sleeps I have had in a city hotel. Breakfast buffet, was slightly mediocre. However, the a la carte option was a much better experience. The breakfast rate includes both a la carte as well as buffet. There was Arabian humus and flat bread to one side, and health bran options and muffins on the other. The service at breakfast was utterly impeccable. Theo Randals restaurant in the lobby was good but not devine, on visits to Nobu and Novikov, I was much more delighted. I would recommend that you not confine your meals to the Hotel restauants alone. The Location is phenomenol! A 5 minute walk from Harrods and under 15 to Bond Street. Oxford Street is a stones throw away as well. Just be sure you're comfortable walking. With a cab fare beginning at £2,50 approximately its more effective walking. And the walk is pleasant too! Throughout my stay, I was blown away by one key factor- Service! The receptionist was very helpful in splitting the bills and thoroughly going through all charges himself. Even having him picking up certain charges which were inaccurate that we were not even aware of. I believe that its not a question on how grand the establishment is, but rather how grand the driving force behind it is. I would be back here many times. I have infact booked to be back at the IC on my next trip!
UR126134078	An uniterested recepionist greeted me at this Intercontinental. Treated me and others as if we were dumb. Although I am a Platinum Ambassador member with an upgrade guaranteed, I was given probably the tiniest room available with the lowest ceiling possible. I did not protest, all I wanted was for my stay to end ( 3 days) I did not like it and will not come back. To worsen things, the concierge was impolite and was disturbed because he decided to assist someone that was behind me in th queue and I protested. In the very noisy lobby bar..the choice of teas was good.
UR125931160	Me and my girlfriend arrived at the hotel at 1pm. Although check in does not open until 3pm the lady at checkin was able to allocate a room immediately. As I am an IC Ambassador I was also given a complimentary upgrade from a classic room to a Superior London room and offered club lounge access for Â£65 plus VAT. The room it self had only been refurbished a month ago and was really well presented. The attention to detail was excellent, from the Elemis toileteries to the Nespresso coffee machine. Only issue was that my complimentary ambassador fruit bowl and water had not arrived and I had to call down for this. However given the fact that I checked in so early it probably was a slight oversight. When it did arrive, the service was fast and the fruit bowl was great - even included a box of expensive cookies. The club lounge is absolutely amazing. The views over Hyde Park Corner magnificent and the quality of the breakfast, canapÃ©s and coffee excellent. From 5:30pm - 7:30pm they have a premium cocktail hour where we drank loads of complimentary champaign and were spoilt for choice. In the cookbook cafe we were even surprised to receive a complimentary desert with happy anniversary written on the plate (mentioned it when I made the reservation but did not think they would actually add the touch - which was greatly appreciated) Would definitely come back and the quality of this hotel is well worth the price!
UR125717472	My husband and I stayed here while in London on holiday. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They were always available for whatever we needed, be it directions, suggestions, or anything in between. The room was great and spotless. The food and drinks we experienced there were also great. The location is perfect, the tube station is just steps away. Also easy walking distance to most of the popular attractions and countless restaurants. Will be staying there again on our next visit!
UR125542089	Took my wife for a treat day out. We went to the hotel for lunch. had the best service from the staff and made sure I thanked them for there great charm and dleivery of the whole days fun. We went for the Champange-Afternoon tea. For afternoon tea, you get cakes, sammies and sones with cream and jam. The sammies were bread Smoked salmon with cavia, chicken with egg mayo plus rare beef. Yummy and you can ask for more should you need to. WE DID..!! We stayed for 2.5 hours and loved every minuet of the day. I would totaly recommend this day as a must do day. Book up and treat the wife or HUBBY..!!
UR125504976	We stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane for a romantic weekend break to celebrate our anniversary. We were very impressed with the friendly and professional check in by Olivia. She was very informative and it was nice to experience a check in where the receptionist is willing to engage and sincerely interested in the purpose of your stay. She gave us a nice Deluxe room overlooking the Arch. The room was spacious for London standards and wow, the bed was extremely comfortable with the crispest linnen and soft pillows. It felt like sleeping in soft clouds! We didn't want to get out of our bed and check out of the hotel at all. We even took off the pillow covers the next day to check which make the pillows are from so we can buy them. There was a powerful rainshower, and nice Elemis amenities in the bathroom. The Bose sound system played the tunes from our Iphones on the background. We had some drinks in the bar on Saturday night and the staff were good in recommending different cocktails and engaging with the guests creating a nice atmosphere. We ended up chatting with different guests staying at the hotel and we all had a good time. We didn't eat in the hotel and ended up eating at a Lebanse restaurant 10 minute walk away called Fakhreldine, very nice. Unfortunately Olivia was occupied during check out, so one of her colleagues checked us out. All in all a great stay on Park Lane, unfortunately only for 1 night, we would love to go back.
UR125434625	I was fortunate to stay at the Intercon. Park Lane for a business visit in February. I was very pleasant with the service, the quality of the room and the breakfast. The hotel was unable to give an early check-in as they were very busy, but they did allow me to have a shower at the 7th floor which was appreciated, especially since the room was not available until slightly after 3pm which should've been the check-in. One negative factor is the mobile reception which is terrible in the hotel, especially I found in the lobby and restaurant. I had a few instances of delayed meetings due to inability to send/receive text messages. Also while I didn't enquire extensively, it doesn't seem to have a free wifi service which would be useful and becoming a standard expectation nowadays. The service was generally quite good and helpful when I had lost a jewellery item they were understanding and did their best to assist. The location is very handy to Hyde Park / Green Park, and walkable to Buckingham Palace and across to the Westminster area, so very handy for sightseeing. Overall it's a very nice place to stay if you can afford it!
UR125331588	We stayed at the Intercon at the begining of Feb, I had stayed here before and had a couple of probems, however they have fully redeemed themselves. The room this time was spacious and had a fablous views over Hyde Park, truly beautiful when watching the snow fall.The staff could not be more helpful and one member of the reception staff has actually driven me to write a letter of commendation. Ok at these prices you expect it to be faultless, but they did go the extra mile. They remembered our names and what we had said we were doing and also enquired about our day when returned to the hotel. It was a pleasurable suprise to find the bar specialised in Gin, over 36 varieties I believe! No we did not try them all, another good reason to return though.
UR125299700	My husband and I stayed here for our 5th wedding anniversary and were very happy with both our room and the service. The room was spacious, bright, well-appointed and spotless. The staff were very helpful and professional. As it was our anniversary we were surprised with a lovely cake, fruit and biscuits which were discretely left in our room. This is obviously a top end London hotel and the prices in the restaurant, bar etc reflect this. However, despite every intention to eat elsewhere, we overlooked the cost and ate every meal at the hotel - the eggs benedict were fantastic! We wish we were still there!
UR125266215	I Had the pleasure to stay there on a short business tri and did enjoy! Trendy place with a lovely team& great service and attentions to details we're huge; Breakfasts are quality ones and you will be more than glad of the location which is just brilliant very near the "Dorchester" but much more fun here! the team was kind enough to upgrade me as soon as i arrived even if it was my first visit here.. Last ,i did enjoy the sophistication but not pretentious if you see what i mean and very last, good tunes with sometimes somas DJ residents who come mixing..! Book ! Cheers ,Oliver Behar from Marrakech
UR125194014	We stayed at this hotel in February of this year. We booked the hotel with our priority club reward points. We also booked a car from them to pick us up at the airport. The car service was good and as we arrived quite early in the morning 7:30am we were not expecting to be able to check in until later. We were actually able to check in as soon as we arrived and as we payed extra for club floor access we also were able to have breakfast as soon as we arrived. Every time we went to the club floor the staff were incredible helpful and friendly. Well worth the extra money to have access. The rooms were small but well appointed. Would definitely recommend staying here.
UR125138887	I've stayed in numerous hotels all over the world and cannot even begin to describe the horrors I've seen and experienced. That was not the case with this hotel. Upon entering you are greeted by friendly and professional staff. The lobby is beautifully decorated with amazing flower displays. I cannot figure out if it is the flowers in the lobby or something they put in the air conditioning but the hotel lobby smells AMAZING! The rooms are beautiful and spacious - especially for central London. The hotel is centrally located within easy walking distance to main attractions such as Buckingham Palace and Picadilly Circus and if you fancy a different venue you are able to take the tube a few minutes walk away. Enough cannot be said about the staff - they are attentive, friendly, professional and extremely effective at what they do (they went above and beyond to assist me with whatever I needed). I loved staying here and would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family... or anyone that stands still long enough to listen!
UR125131558	We had a very enjoyable overnight stay at this hotel last weekend. The staff were very helpful and the hotel itself clean and modern. It's expensive, but you know that already (the words "Park" and "Lane" are a bit of a giveaway), although we got a great deal on the room on Expedia. One small gripe, the room was a bit stuffy but then I do like fresh air which is a problem in most hotels these days where you can't actually open the window
UR124975948	I stayed at the hotel for a weekend break for 2 nights as a surprise for my 40th birthday. We were in an Executive suite. The hotel is well located on Park Lane and as such close to the very heart of London. The tube station (Hyde Park corner) is only a 2 minute walk away. The staff were all very attentive and welcoming on arrival at the hotel. A quick and easy check in followed. We decided to have a drink in the bar before going to our room, be warned the prices are rather expensive even by London standards! The room was a great size with all the amenities one would expect from a 5* hotel. The bed was super comfy and I probably had one of the best nights sleep ever! However, one down side is that there is no free wifi anywhere?! This I found rather disappointing considering how good the hotel was overall. If your paying a premium for a room you shouldn't be paying extra for wifi, I mean you get it free in McDonalds! Nonetheless, this seems to be quite a regular occurrence when I stay in finer hotels. In summary, a great hotel in a cracking location. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone on a good budget wanting to stay in London.
UR124890598	I had an amazing stay. The hotel was beautiful, the room was great. The service was outstanding! And the afternoon tea was so good! I'm coming back, that's for sure.
UR124867544	We booked this hotel as part of a romantic break in London. The hotel oozed luxury and as you would expect it was immaculately clean. The staff were really friendly and offered ideas about where to go for a drink and even helped us to select a suitable cocktail from the list in the lounge bar. The door staff were keen to help with directions and taxis. The room was spacious and contained all of the extras that you would expect from a hotel of this standard. The whole experience overall was wonderful and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.
UR124792544	Booked this hotel through last minute.com's secret hotel option so got a good deal. Staff were very friendly and efficient and the lobby stylish and contempory. Valet parking was available on arrival which we took at the cost of Â£50.00 for 24 hours - it is London!! The room was comfortable, slightly more 'traditional' in style and as a personal preference it would've been nicer in a contempory style to match the lobby etc. No complementary bottles of water in the room, but overall good value for the price. I would have been disappointed if I'd have paid full price for that particular room!
UR124775223	Excellent two night stay, pure class. Very high quality welcome, beautiful room, excellent amenities right down to the Bose sound system and the Elemis toiletries. You would expect great things from an address like this and the Intercontinental does not disappoint.
UR124576184	This hotel blew us away. We won this hotel bidding on priceline and got a very good rate. It was for our honeymoon and I emailed the hotel to ask for a spa menu and mentioned that we were on our honeymoon a few months before we arrived. They went out of their way to make our honeymoon special. We were upgraded to a huge room by London standards on the top floor with a huge balcony and bathroom. The first night at turndown we had a happy honeymoon card and a delicious dessert. We were very surprised because when we checked in we did not tell anyone that it was our honeymoon, they must have noted this from my email months prior. The second night at turndown they gave us a bottle of Moet champagne and a box of chocolates with another card.We were also given free drinks at the very trendy bar that has a club license and can stay open late, which is great for Americans that are not ready to go to sleep at 11:00 when all of the pubs close. The location is perfect. There are several restaurants and pubs close by and you can walk to almost all of the major attractions.I would highly recommend this hotel and we will be back soon!
UR124538065	We enjoyed two nights in a suite this weekend. The Intercontinental, Park Lane is not cheap but you get what you pay for! Our suite was very comfortable, not huge but more than enough space to kick back and relax. We were entitled to use the Club lounge which was lovely. Evening drinks and snacks were very well received and Moet champagne freely flowing. Breakfast in the Club lounge was very civilized as we overlooked Hyde Park Corner. An expensively luxurious weekend at the Intercontinental!
UR124531935	Great hotel, centrally located by Green Park and Hyde Park Tube stations. Hyde Park is actually closer in case you are walking. Service was fabulous. Room was nicely laid out - a decent size for a London Hotel. Bose sound station, Bang & Olsten television. Bedding was wonderful. Unique wines in the lounge restaurant. El Pirata a couple blocks away for some great Spanish Tapas.
UR124404817	Two stays over the past 18 months or so. On both occasions, I've been upgraded, once to a larger room with a courtyard view and the second time to a room on one of the top floors with a balcony and a view over Green Park. Both rooms were very comfortable, but the second one would have been cramped for two. On the first stay I had breakfast in the dining room, which was not peaceful and where the tables are very close to each other. The service was also rather offhand. For the second stay, I ordered breakfast in the room, which was a far better experience and well worth the small additional cost. It arrived on a trolley with a warmed compartment so that the hot food was still hot when it arrived. Despite the rather impersoanl feel to the hotel, the reception staff were welcoming on both occasions.
UR124297894	Best of locations. Great service and food. Courteous staff. Suites impeccable. Highly recommended form any tourist or business traveler to London
UR124269827	Beautifully decorated hotel in a truly excellent location. Short walk to Hyde Park tube station and close to many prime attractions. I enjoyed the walk down to The Royal Academy on Picadilly. My teenage son enjoyed the proximity to The Hard Rock Cafe where we had a fin evening. Room was beautifully furnished with a large comfortable bed, and the shower was amazing. However the room was just a little on the small side. I had to wait a short while to get into the room as my husband was parking the car and had the booking details etc but the staff looked after us with complementary drinks. Drinks on the bar are prohibitively expensive, but we found a nice pub in the side street just by the hotel. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable stay.
UR124268811	Nice hotel in a great location. Having secured a bit of a bargain via hotwire I was unsurprised to be given an average room with no view. It was nicely kitted out, bed was comfy, all you could ask for 140 for a monday night in Mayfair. Due to the bargain nature I wasn't suprised to be located next to the lifts on the 8th floor and although the noise was a minor annoyance throughout the night, it wasn't quite as annoying as the smell of frying onions wafting up from the kitchens from 8.30am onwards. The public areas are smart and understated and we enjoyed a couple of cocktails from the lobby after a day out and about in London. They were nicely made, but it was unfortunate that we had to wait 30 mins for them and when I enquired how much longer, I was told by the very helpful waiter "sorry, there is no bar tender in the hotel at the moment so it's taking me longer to make them as I don't normally". As delicious as they were and he did a sterling job, waiting 30 mins for drinks costing Â£35 was not really on at a 5 star hotel. We weren't going to have breakfast at the hotel but as we were offered it at check-in for a reduced rate of Â£20 per person instead of Â£28 we decided to go for it. It was as you might expect a varied affair and very nice indeed, it was a bit of a shame that the tables are close together so the waiters tend to bump the back of your chair by accident, which is a little wearing after about the 5th time. I was however decidedly dissapointed on check-out to find they had quoted the cost minus vat and so the cost was actually Â£48 for teo. I find it very annoying when luxury hotels take what feels like a cheap shot at guests by doing this. It is not standard practice to quote prices exclusive of vat in the UK and the IC really does itself down in the reputation stakes with this. Next time I'm in the area I'll spring for the Dorchester I think. The IC was good, but not quite good enough sadly.
UR124261298	This was booked for a leisure weekend via top secret hotels on last minute.com. I was very apprehensive as it was a good deal and I worried that it mightn't be up to much. Not so. Beautiful public areas, bar and restaurants. Bedrooms are ok, average size, average furnishings but very good bathrooms and beds. Also tea and coffee facilities in the bedroom which is so appreciated. Husband worked from bedroom during the day and said it was very quiet. Staff were extremely helpful and our meals in the cookbook cafe were very good Downsides would be expensive wifi and extortionate drinks bills. The location is excellent on park lane and in the heart of Mayfair.
UR124073113	Extremely courteous staff and comfortable, clean room, although I guess I expected it to be larger . . . maybe that's not possible in central London. It was very convenient for our visits to the Halcyon Gallery, Wild Honey, Harrods and the V&A. I'm still giggling about pulling up to the door in our Ford Focus in amongst the Mercs and Maseratis. The doorman was charming though! I was astounded that breakfast was Â£28 though - for that I'd want George Clooney serving it to me in bed.
UR124066569	Fabulous hotel in a great location. Well situated for all sightseeing, restaurants and tubes. Rooms good and hotel public areas great but restaurant service especially in the mornings is slow with dirty dishes piled high
UR123995285	Just returned from a 5 night stay at the beautifully renovated Intercontinental Park Lane in London. This hotel is conveniently located close to the Hyde Park underground station and is within walking distance to Hyde Park and Green Park. As I mentioned the hotel has been renovated, but has some problems still. They were changing over to digital cable while we were there and more times then not, we had to call down to the front desk to have the cable box reset and the internet connection was spotty at best. The rooms were on the small side, but what hotels in London aren't? The beds were very comfortable and the rain showerhead was delightful. They also had tremendous customer service. They were quick to follow-up on any issues that were reported. This hotel had limited restaurant selections, but more are being added. It is within walking distance to the Hard Rock Cafe, which was expensive and crowded, but a site many people want to see. We did a sightseeing tour and took in a play in London's West End. London continues to be one of my favorite cities. It is on the expensive side, but if you look for bargains, they are out there.
UR123898022	Have stayed in several good hotels in London but for the past 2 years, I have been going back to the intercontinental. The location is superb, just a trot from Knightsbridge, tons of cabs and the tube next door. The rooms are all decent and service is generally attentive and polite. Apart from one rude individual at reception, all the lovely ladies have been helpful and obliging. The food in both the cafe as well as the tea in the lounge are fabulous. The best scones with clotted cream and jam I have ever had and a yummy organic buffet at lunch in the cookbook cafe....I cant imagine staying any where else in London..
UR123753757	Loved this hotel, Very good service staff couldnt help enough, rooms were very clean and bed was very comfy great pillows, Brillant location 10 minute walk to harrods in one direction 15 min to piccadilly circus the other, Would use again
UR123338262	Jet lagged from Miami flight. Upon arriving at the hotel, my spirit bounced back. I felt invigorated. The hotel was spectacular. Stunning location in Mayfair. Beautiful lobby. Fantastic staff. Large room, for London anyway, with classical furniture. Impressive bathroom. Theo Randall restaurant was Phenomenal!, I felt like I was eating in Italy.
UR123306852	Great location VERY comfortable beds Small rooms
UR123170026	My family stayed for 4 nights in January in interconnecting rooms that we had requested. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were good size, well appointed and very well serviced. Proximity to the tube was very welcome as was the short stroll to Knightsbridge, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. We will use this hotel again.
UR122981065	Stayed here twice in 6 months - latterly because we were invited to a Garden Perty at the Palace. This has to be one of the nicest hotels in London for service and quality. No hesitation about endorsing it.
UR122933368	I love this hotel. The rooms are spacious and bright. The staff is amazing. Food and beverage service - though pricey - which is to be expected given the neighborhood - is wonderful. I give this 5 star hotel, a 5 star rating. Great location - walking distance to major attractions and the park is right across the street. Tube stop on the Picadilly line is right on the corner - and it's just a 45 minute ride to Heathrow with no change of train. My only complaint, and this is true of many (but not all) hotels I've stayed in recently, is that the WiFi access is too expensive and this continues to be a pet peeve of mine. WiFi doesn't have to cost a fortune and shouldn't. In this day and age, it should be part of the room amenities. I will certainly be back.
UR122915812	I stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane between 26 Dec -2 Jan 2012. The hotel has a perfect location in walking distance from Picadilly on one side and Knightsbrige on the other. Metro station, buses and taxis are all readily available and nearby. The hotel is pretty much what you expect from an Intercontinental. On the plus side: the staff (really nice and helpful), the overall atmosphere in the common areas (lobby, bars, etc) and breakfast. On the minus side: room size (but this is London..not really where you will find the largest rooms). Price is adequate for what you get, Reccomended.
UR122857972	stayed at this hotel for new year, excellent location and excellent price booked with hotwire. hotel staff very helpful,spotlessly clean. Right next to hyde park corner tube station. ONly downside drinks very expensive Â£5 for bottle of water or can of coke so take your own. Overall very enjoyable stay.
UR122793785	this was my second visit to this hotel, staff are always friendly and rooms clean and tidy, this time the room seemed to have been renovated, you never get any extras,even as a platinum memeber of the IHG rewards programme. The beds (matress and pillows) are always outstanding at Intercontinental Hotels.
UR122770833	I am a bad critic because I rarely leave a bad review, instead I leave the positive ones and do not comment on the rest. In this case I'll make an exception. The last time in London we stayed at The Ritz, a proper 5* hotel, these guys are so far off the standard they should lose a star at least. We arrived and the front door was opened for us as one would expect, this happened less than 50% of the time we entered and exited-either do it or don't. We checked in and went to our room. There was a small residue of poo in the toilet. The coffee was Nescafe (5*?) and there was no welcome information. The TV was complex and slow to work, the signal was also poor. We got ready to leave but the water in the tiny bathroom was only slightly above luke warm (later we were told of a safety switch but there was no label or marking to show this). We left for a pleasant evening out and returned to the hotel bar. My wife nipped to the loo whilst I was ignored by the hotel waitresses for some time. There were other ladies here who seemed more interested than the staff. Eventually after waiting for 20 minutes for a bottle of bog standard Pinot (for Â£44!) we gave up and left. Everything around was closed so we returned to our room and ordered room service (same bottle Â£40) this arrived quickly and they were polite so we ordered a Pizza. This was inedible. The description made it sound like a really decent choice but it had plastic cheese and no herb or seasoning. We sent it back (they did offer a replacement which we declined) I kept a 3cm piece to show them in the morning, a bit OTT I know but it was that bad. We were woken in the morning with drilling and hammering very loudly on top of our room. I called reception who said yeah we're doing maintenance. I told them to make them stop and 10 minutes of noise later they did, so much for a nice lie in. We complained on leaving and the manager came to see us. His response was apologetic and he got the food and beverage manager. He asked what we had ordered and we said a Margarita pizza, I showed him the slice and asked him if it matched the menu description, he said, so, its just cheese with a bit of tomato paste innit?. I asked him if he knew what the description on his own menu was, he clearly did not and seemed pretty uninterested. Now the manager did the right thing and comped our wine which was acceptable but my favourite bit which made my stay was his response to us questioning the nature of the "ladies" frequenting his bar at night. I'm not naive enough to think that some business types are not open in Mayfair at night but this seemed particularly blatant for a (5*) Hotel. His response was that they do not discriminate towards the professions of those who frequent the bar in the evening. I did mention that this was absolute gold for my review. In conclusion please refer to the title, if you don't want the extras then go stop at The Ritz, it's really little more than a posh Travelodge here.
UR122737045	Knight takes King here on Park Lane. This is a well positioned hotel, well maintained and certainly equipped to suite it's clientle. They know how to treat guest and stand by that standard. You don't get the feeling they are being held to anything that they do not hold themselves responsible for. ***** Stars on all fronts. I will only choose IH-PL
UR122706449	Fantastic location but unfortunately a 3 star hotel. This is the first time that I have written a negative review. The toilet had remnants of poo at the bottom of it! The hot water was barely hot (this was rectified by the hotel). The lobby bar was full of prostitutes so we had to retreat to our room after waiting over 20 minutes to try and get a drink. Room service was actually very quick but the pizza we ordered was inedible. We were rudely awoken by drilling in the room above in the morning. The management did not charge us for the room service in fairness. Not a great experience, would not stay again and certainly does not deserve a 5 star rating.
UR122507213	We've stayed at the Intercontinental before and I'm glad to say it is still as good as it was! Very friendly staff: front desk, concierge, barmen, doormen: everyone is friendly, willing to help and really trying to make you feel welcome. We stayed here at the end of december to do some celebrations and got a good deal through priceline. The room we got was on the 7th floor. Not a huge room, but according to London standard certainly not small either. Above all: it was clean and very comfortable. We didn't use the restaurant during this stay, so I can't comment on that. In terms of location is remains one of my favorite hotels in London. Very central, next to Hyde Park, Park Lane, close to Oxford st., and the underground station next door takes you to all the major sites in minutes! It is not the cheapest hotel, but definitely worth the price! And I will keep coming back when I go to London.
UR122428211	I stayed two nights recently at the Park Lane Intercontinental. This was my second stay at this hotel. On this occasion, I was redeeming award nights as a platinum ambassador member of the IHG group. No provision for complementary breakfast or internet access was offerred for being a member of platinum ambassador status. The cost of internet access is quite expensive at 15 GBP daily. This is in contrast with the Hilton group of hotels which looks after its diamond status members with complementary breakfast and internet access. Our room was small but comfortable having been recently refurbished. The Intercontinental beds and pillows are legendary of course. The location of this hotel is brilliant, with an easy stroll through Mayfair and on to Oxford St or down to Knightbridge. The staff were helpful, but the atmosphere of the hotel is rather cold and formal. In future I would look at staying somewhere that there is more emphasis on personalised attention.
UR122425775	This room in this hotel was world class cant comment on the rest of the hotel as we straight to the room then out for the evening. You could not find fault it was perfection, they pay a lot of attention to detail but of course you paying for it, all our subsequent hotel visits are judged by this benchmark. we went the Intercontinental in Taba eygpt which we thought would be the same, but trust me its not Egypt has a much lower standard still nice but a big difference
UR122414593	I've stayed at this property twice. Both times I paid around 150 USD through priceline. This is an excellent hotel overall. The rooms are clean and relatively spacious. The location is very central. The staff are quite friendly and helpful. I stayed at the Four Seasons across the street and in my opinion, this hotel is nicer and cheaper. The hotel shows up a lot of priceline!
UR122268299	I booked the intercontinental via expedia secret hotels. I paid Â£125 per night and paid Â£30 per night for an upgrade to a superior room. The room was a good size with all the facilities you could need or want. The staff were all extremely helpful. I cannot fault this hotel. The only thing I would say is that food and drinks are expensive but you do expect that in a 5* hotel. They should offer free wifi like most hotels do now.
UR122246836	We returned to this hotel having visited a couple of years ago. We arrived just after lunch and decided that as our suite was not quite ready we would go and do a bit of shopping etc. The reception service was excellent and when we returned our room was ready and our suitcases were already in our suite. Our suite was beautifully decorated with excellent amenties, however upon entering our suite there was a very bad smell of smoke. We immediately discussed this with the lady in the Club Lounge and she appologised and said that there were no further rooms available, but would arrange for housekeeping to freshen up our suite whilst we are eating out that evening. This was acceptable to us, but we were disappointed that we had been put in a smoking room in the first place !! That evening when we returned it was obvious that our suite had not been cleaned etc. The smell of smoke was still there. It was to late to complain, so we decided to sort this out the next morning. We arrived in the Club Lounge for breakfast the next morning and we discussed this with another lady who promised to get this sorted. We had our breakfast and left this with her to sort out. Later that day we returned and the same lady was very apologetic and arranged for us to be moved to another suite, the hotel staff also moved our belongings. Yes things do go wrong sometimes - it happens ! but as long as it is sorted out to a staisfactory manner then why complain further ?. The Club Lounge staff could not do enough for us - the service they offered was excellent. This is everything we expect from this hotel. Apart from a little hiccup our stay was fabulous, our new suite was excellent, breakfast in the Club Lounge was delicious and it was feshly cooked. We look forward to returning very soon.
UR122177480	The lobby area seems to have been improved and the space is much more inviting than it used to be. I must admit that I fall for the flower arrangements and the lighting in this hotel - and the upholstery and fabrics in the rooms are the highest quality. The room was very clean and spacious - and although the bathroom was nice, it was a bit of a squeeze. It is a good length bath though. I liked the view of Park Lane. This used to be my favourite London venue for breakfast - it used to be amazing when it was downstairs - they are doing it rather differently now?
UR122143064	The location is brilliant, right next to buckingham palace and Hyde park. The rooms are comfortable and quiet, but we thought it was very expensive considering it did not have a pool or similar facilities.
UR122007762	Book in advance and you can get a decent price for this hotel. I have always booked the cheapest room and they've always upgraded me. Never used the Club Room as it seems like a very expensive way to buy breakfast. Rooms are very large for London, clean and comfortable. I did a lot of work in the room itself and didn't have any issues. Bathroom is nice, which is something I am always very picky about. Bathtub fills very quickly though which is a common problem in London hotels. Ultra-fast check-in and check-out. Room service was efficient. Housekeeping was absolutely fine. Fast internet. Nice to see the wifi internet is reasonably fast - something a lot of London hotels, even business hotels, fail to deliver. Couldn't really fault anything except the food was very average for the expensive price. Otherwise it was entirely what I was expecting from an Intercontinental. Location is not ideal if you are a tourist as Piccadilly, Marble Arch and Oxford Circus are quite a long walk away. Nearest tube stations are Green Park and Hyde Park Corner.
UR121992086	By the time my partner and I arrived at IC Park Lane I had already formed a very high opinion of the hotel thanks to an extensive email correspondence with Ildi at the concierge desk. In planning a day long event for my partner's 60th birthday, Ildi was absolutely invaluable in making arrangements, checking schedules and securing those hard-to-get restaurant reservations, and during the course of many emails her enthusiasm and creative suggestions were key to making the day into a very special event. The hotel is in a terrific location, across the street from Apsley House and the Wellington Arch; and in addition to the Hyde Park tube stop on the Piccadilly line, the roundabout in front of the hotel is served by several bus lines. Strolling out the front door in one direction will take you to Hyde Park and eventually Kensington, while the other direction leads you directly to Mayfair - keep walking and soon you're in Piccadilly Circus. Check in was smooth (in the interest of disclosure I should say I'm a member of the Intercontinental Ambassador Club) and we received an upgrade I wasn't expecting as this stay had been booked part points and part cash. We were given a Studio Suite on the 2nd floor, very spacious with a shower separate from the tub, a heated towel rack and a bidet. Our view was of Apsley House, home of the Duke of Wellington and we could also overlokked Hyde Park and the Lanesborough Hotel. The room was immaculate and crisp and showed signs of recent refurbishment, as does the entire hotel. Bright, light and airy is the effect, and it's very nice to walk into; it feels quite rich without being cluttered or stuffy. The overall feeling you get here is that this is a "happy house" to be in; all of the employees we encountered seemed genuinely interested in making our stay pleasant, whether it was Mikael the doorman (who has a great smile and apparently can produce taxis out of thin air -- thank you, Mikael!), the waiters and maÃ®tre d' at the Cookbook Cafe or any of the staff we encountered. We had access to the Club Intercontinental on the 7th floor, where all the tables along the outside wall have a view of the Wellington Arch. Access to the Club is either included in your room rate or available for purchase (I believe the price is 60GBP) and includes breakfast (continental-style and cooked - I had perfectly soft-boiled eggs every morning), coffee and tea during the day, afternoon tea with sandwiches, pastries and cakes, and early evening cocktails and wine, all complimentary. The staff here, as in the entire hotel, are friendly and welcoming as well as being multi-lingual; you'll hear many languages being spoken here. Special recognition has to go the bartenders at the Arch Bar (yes, it looks out at the Wellington Arch -- how did you know?). Fabio, Stefano, Andre, Ruben and Nicolas are making classic cocktails and recreating historic ones, and if you have an interest in such things you should have a seat at the bar and prepare to be amazed. Fabio is making his own infusions and is working on a degree in alchemy, Ruben shakes one of the world's great Sidecars and you should ask Andre to make you that coffee flavored cocktail he's working on, the one with ground coffee beans floating in it. It doesn't have a name yet, but it's good, very very good! So, yes, I'm effusive; to balance that, I can say that not everything was perfect. We suffered a very minor service glitch when our supply of complimentary bottled water ran dry (it was to be replenished daily, but this wasn't always done) but in the great scheme of things? It was a minor annoyance that didn't impact our stay. The overall impression I left with was that of a energetic, knowledgeable, hard-working and pleasant staff who are working enthusiastically in the hospitality industry. We definitely plan on returning.
UR121986848	Pre-Christmas London-weekend at the Intercontinental in Park Lane. Very nice hotel of course - five stars in London is undoubtedly pretty luxurious. We got a great deal through Hotwire, and that made it a very good deal. The hotel is large, and in walking-distance and easy bus- and metro-reach of most things. The metro to Heathrow is just outside on the other side of the street. Hyde park is right by, and you can easily walk to Harrods in Knightsbridge and Oxford Street. Covent Garden and the theatre district is easily reachable by bus and metro. The rooms are large and spacious, and the bed was great. Only negatives; there is no free wifi, the cleaning of the rooms came quite late in the day (almost 3:30), and the price of breakfast is a steep 35 pounds. Not for our pockets, but I guess the usual Intercontinental-guests donÂ´t mind. Overall a great hotel if you get a good deal online. Personally tough, we prefer the Covent Garden-area with lots more activity, restaurants and shops, and will spend our money staying there the next time.
UR121941202	The refurbishment has made a huge difference to this hotel. Its now our London favorite. It very useful for business meetings as it has a very good,bright lounge area. The Club rooms and Lounge are excellent. The staff are first class and yes, it is expensive, but you should know that before you go. Its difficult to fault this hotel at the moment.
UR121925388	We stayed one night - room only - using Priority Club points. The hotel is very nice and in a fantastic location on Park Lane between Hyde Park and Green Park (both have tube stations within an easy walk of the hotel). The lobby is contemporary and luxurious. Front desk staff are immaculately turned out and extremely professional - only the beautiful people seem to work here! However I did feel that I was being checked in by a Revenue Manager rather than a Receptionist as the emphasis was very much on upselling. Breakfast? No thanks. Dinner? No thanks. Club Lounge access? (Â£108). No thanks. Just when I thought we'd finished she noticed my Ambassador membership had expired and asked if I'd like to renew for $150. No thanks! I was then handed my room key and bid a polite farewell. Despite being a Priority Club member no room upgrade was offered. I did feel that if I'd answered "Yes" to any of the above then I'd probably have been upgraded. A little disappointing as I've already demonstrated my loyalty to IHG Hotels by being a Platinum member. The room on the 8th (top) floor was a little cold when I entered but soon warmed up once the air con was switched on. The room was rather small even by European standards (tiny by US standards). I checked the fire escape plan behind the door and yes this was a standard king room - all the standard rooms are the same size. TIP: If you're expecting a large room then definitely upgrade. Whilst rather compact the room was well furnished with a big comfortable bed, a Bang & Olufsen TV and a Bose CD player with ipod dock. The bathroom was spotless if again rather compact. The over bath shower head was enormous and gave a real monsoon experience. TIP: If you didn't want to get your hair wet there's an adjustable wall mounted shower head that could be separately operated. Top quality Elemis shampoo and bath gel provided along with other Elemis products. We returned later that evening to find that our room had been turned down. The used Elemis products replaced, fresh towels provided and a bottle of complimentary mineral water and fresh fruit had been placed in the room. A small card had been left indicating the following day's weather. A really nice touch. The next morning we skipped breakfast in the hotel - an eyewatering Â£30 each plus Â£5 delivery charge to the room. TIP: We walked across to Hyde Park and sat in the beautiful 1960's pavillion on the edge of the Serpentine where we enjoyed a superb full English Breakfast - cooked to order - for only Â£8.60 The coffee was top quality too. I can't comment on the hotel restaurant - we ate out for both dinner and breakfast. However, the staff we encountered at the Intercontinental were charming, helpful and extremely professional. Housekeeping standards were amongst some of the best I've ever seen and our room (whilst a little small) was very comfortable and immaculately presented. Attention to detail really sets this hotel apart. I would highly recommend the Intercontinental for its location, service and comfort of the rooms. My only slight disappointment (and the reason why I couldn't in all honesty give 5 stars) was the size of their standard rooms and the lack of an upgrade as a Priority Club member.
UR121903906	Stayed here October 17-20. London was our first stop on our little family eurotrip. First impression of the hotel is a good one. Its a modern building with a fantastik lobby. Check in was quick and easy and they let us check in at 10 am which was very much appreciated after our long flight from New York. I was a little shocked the my room was so traditional which was in strike contrast to the modern lobby and fascade of the hotel but the room was very clean and well cared for. Rooms are small in London and this hotel went along with the trend. I love staying in Mayfair. Its safe for walking to just about anywhere at night. I got a great price on the hotel but even if I didn't I would probably still stay here again.
UR121860896	We have just spent two evenings here. Great location, really comfy bed and clean sheets daily. Cant thank the Concierge desk enough for their help - they even got us on the guest list for the Bunny Club (it was my birthday). Everything was really good. One criticism though - we were on a complimentary stay which included breakfast. The restaurant was not aware of this so on the first morning we could have eaten more - if that was possible!! - (I was a bit aggrieved I missed out on the best apple juice in town!) Staff are happy, completely professional and well turned out although there seemed to be a real lack of English speaking employees. I found this annoying because although staff can mostly speak English it is difficult to understand the accent particularly when they are rushed and speak quickly. Otherwise, the sink was leaking a bit, but we didn't mention it as it did not bother us because, although pricey, we had a great time - thanks again to Concierge (and the hotel for donating this prize to Help for Heroes). I would recommend the hotel.
UR121854444	I am a member of the Ambassador program and stayed at this property for one night in December. I received an upgrade to a slightly larger than normal room but it wasn't overwhelming. The hotel is well located and I enjoyed walking around outside. You get a typical Intercon experience at this property. Good rooms, good food, well located. Nothing out of the ordinary and if you are a fan of the Intercontinental brand, this property is worth visiting.
UR121729956	This is a super spot in Mayfair.I had a room over looking Hamilton Place and Hyde Park. Its very modern with black and white the theme. Lovely marble everywhere. A bose sound system in the room. My rate didn't include breakfast which was Â£28 in the cafe restaurant a bit pricey. Good smiling service in reception and the cafe
UR121697420	We stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane London for a long week end at the beginning of December, a stay of two types. The check in was timely at the Ambassador desk and as our upgraded room was not yet ready we were offered a temporary room to use for the time being. As we were using our free night certificate as an ambassador we booked the club room for the last two nights which is Â£72.00; this included Breakfast for two Afternoon tea and Evening canapÃ©s and drinks. The Club room has really excellent staff nothing too much trouble but also a keen knowledge of the area as well as other IC hotels in the group. What did disappoint to a small degree was the executive room we were upgraded toâ€™, it was a strange design and we could only view the TV from the bed. The Hanging space was minimal to say the least. However the room was spacious and clean. We remain committed to at least one stay a year in the London IC but would choose the room more carefully in future.
UR121638063	This title really sums it up. Great luxury, service and the location takes the cake. We stayed here five days and felt right at home; bathroom rain shower was a dream, plush bedding with probably the most comfortable bed ever; slept like a baby every night. Concierge helped us with all our requests, gave us great advice and booked all our excursions without any mishaps. At the time of check out, we notice an over charge, they took care of it immediately, no questions asked. We received a thank you letter from the Director of Staff for taking the time to commend the staff. It was the least we could do.
UR121630030	Just returned from a great stay, Service was great, Staff Friendly, Room was Good, We had a great time - Thanks to all the Staff . We had a Room that gave access to Club lounge, and this was great to : Recommend you do this aswell offers great value .
UR121513641	I'll come on to Wildlife on One in a minute but first things first. We stayed at the InterContinental for 1 night as part of my partner's Christmas present. A very well looked after, majestic hotel in a prime location. Check-in was reasonable once we were being served. There was a five minute or so wait to be served but the gentleman serving us was professional and gave us some good information about the Winter Wonderland happening across the road on Hyde Park. A value-added service that impressed us. Room and bathroom were very clean and well kept. Retired to bed around 10:30 (this is what happens when you're a new parent. Even without our 4 month old son we were still asleep by 11!). The bed itself was comfortable and we had no problems getting to sleep until I was rudely awoken by what I thought was a seal-mating documentary being filmed next-door (or above/below). I quickly realised these mating calls were not seals and I also realised that InterContinental put their beds too close to the wall or do not fix their headboards to the wall securely enough. Thankfully this intrusion of my sleep only lasted a matter of minutes before the excitable seals had either fallen asleep or had been rolled back into the sea. Next morning housekeeping decided to try and enter without knocking. I would have politely declined should we have been asked but thankfully I'd set the latch on the door for just such an occasion. Partner took a nice deep bath that filled quickly with hot water. I had a shower and again found it in line with the rest of the standard. We didn't use any of the other hotel services as we were out early the next morning. Would I go again? Maybe if staying for longer but for a single night, I can stay in places much cheaper and be walked in on by poorly-mannered housekeeping staff!
UR121448689	As one so often is (!), I'd been invited down to London to meet the Queen so wanted a hotel close to Buck House. This hotel is normally pricier than we'd use but we booked in advance (via the hotel website, which was cheaper than any .com rooms site). First impression is of tranquility, with a light airy feel and zen / new age music in the background. The room was very nice (as you'd expect) and we had our usual view of the well inside the hotel - the difference being the fact that the (presumably concrete) roof had been Astroturfed. Neat. The staff were very friendly and while polite did not have the stand-offish air you often get in posh hotels. We ate out but breakfast was excellent - make sure you get it inclusive if you can, because it's not cheap.
UR121377630	Our stay was tiring. Our non-smoking room had a odour of cigarettes. Also when we woke up, we had sore throats. Also the service was poor. When we had tea, a cake we ordered never turned up, even worse, in the breakfast room, even though our rate included breakfast, they tried to charge us and we had to go to reception ourselves to resolve this.
UR121368188	The room was impeccably clean and provided a large yet homey atmosphere from books on a bookshelf to a Bose sound system. The room was nicely appointed with comfortable decor, dark wood everywhere and a lovely tea closet with assorted teas and coffee. The staff were very professional and helpful. The Theo Randall restaurant at the hotel was quite good. The doormen were very accommodating.
UR121275796	A family group, we stayed in a double and a twin midweek in November. Rooms are very nice with top notch sound/Tv systems and furnishings you would expect of a 5 star hotel. Breakfast is extremely satisfying with just about anything you could wish for. Yes, everything is expensive, but its a 5 star, what do you expect? We had a complimentary late check out which was nice. You cant go far wrong with the location...... its good for transport, shopping, sightseeing so it ticks all the boxes.
UR121257899	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights this november. Conveniently located in downtown next to Picadilly, lots of stores and restaurants close by. Room was OK size wise, only a tiny bit smaller than what you find in Intercontinental Hotel in North America (I've stayed there before). Rooms is very clean and well maintained. Concierge and staff was generally helpful and very polite. However, in terms of value, the hotel is terrible. At the price they are charging you'd expect complimentary internet. Also the items in the Minibar are ridiculously priced, 5 pounds for a can of Coke or a bottle of water is more than abusive in my opinion. If you don't mind the high price point, it's an OK hotel but quality/price wise, i'd look elsewhere.
UR121244478	I don't find this InterContinental hotel to be as good as the many others I've stayed in. Service around the hotel (bar and room service tends to be very slow and unengaging). I had to chase up 4 times for Ambassador Programme benefits such as complimentary in-room water (via reception twice and the using the Instant Service button twice) and I eventually received it on the second night of my stay. Rooms are also hardy ever available for early check-in either. Check-in from 8am is the defined Royal Ambassador Programme benefit and I arrived and tried at 10.30am and it wasn't ready until 12pm lunchtime. In the downstairs bar you end up waiting for ages at your table (being completely ignored by the staff) and then have to walk up to the bar to get any attention for service. This also happened on my previous stay last year. On the plus side, the Club Lounge facility is wonderful and well worth paying for with an excellent food and drink offering and very attentive and friendly staff. I do feel this hotel needs to up its game on service to be truely 5 star for the prices charged like other IC hotels within the group.
UR121238183	My husband & I stayed here last Saturday & I cannot fault this hotel (stayed in many 5 star London hotels) from the greeting to the check out-we had an upgraded room with a view of Hyde park corner & the room itself was beautifully decorated-we will definitely be checking back in on our next trip to London!
UR121048668	Either I was very unlucky or the Intercontinental has it all wrong. Tired after long haul travel arrived around midnight and just wanted a shower and bed. After a slow check-in process (I assume by a trainee) I arrived to my room and realized it was an handicap room with unusable bathroom. Tried to call reception for 20min and nobody answered so I had to go down to change room. I got then the regular room but already had lost 1 hour of sleep with all process. The 2nd day I wanted to rest for 1 hour in the afternoon (jet-lag!) and there was construction on the floor below, so impossible to sleep with drill noises - all the room was shaking. Never received any information that there was construction going on otherwise would have avoided hotel. After 30 min and 3 calls to desk service, they finally stopped. So I was able to rest for a few minutes. The room service food is of good quality but the 30 minutes waiting time was more like 45 when I requested breakfast so had to eat on the run. On my early check-out the manager apologized for inconveniences. I left London tired with no desire to go back to Intercontinental.
UR121040220	We stated here whilst attending a ball here. The food at the ball was superb. The room was gorgeous and checking in (Dominic) was really good. Did not do breakfast so can't comment on that. Overall pleased with hotel - but PLEASE give free wifi to your guests!!!!!
UR121026479	I stayed at the Intercontinental with a friend on a weekend break in London last month and although I enjoyed the stay and the hotel was nice I left feeling that the stay was average after maybe expecting to be a little wowed......Au-naturalle, this is a personal feeling!! Upon arrival the door staff were very friendly and the reception staff business like and efficient. The room was cozy and the twin beds pushed together. There was also the usuals such as tea and coffee making facilities although there were none of the usual little extras that you get at some of the upper end hotels. The room was equipt with a large flat screen tv and dvd player etc and the bathroom had a bath + shower etc and was a good size. The location of the hotel was probably its best feature as it didnt take long to walk to many of the top London attractions. I didnt use any of the hotels other facilities.
UR120951885	Stayed here for two nights in November on a hotwire deal of $180 per night. Arrived a bit too early for room to be ready, but the checkin lady was very nice, stored my bags and I was off to lunch. Great location ate Hyde Park Corner (on the Picadilly line from LHR or a 10 pound cab ride from Paddington if you use the Heathrow Express). When I returned about 1:30 the room was ready and bags had already been delivered. The room was very nice and clean...perhaps not the biggest room in the hotel, but for half the regular price, I did not expect the royal suite. The room had no view and faced the internal courtyard, which was fine with me because it was very quiet. The public area are tastefully done and smelled great. Had a few drinks at the bar which was very pleasant. Overall, great for the price I paid.
UR120822049	Stayed here on 5th November 11, the hotel was fantastic as ever, the newly refurbished foyer looks great, the room was tastefully furnised with a really comfortable bed with egyptian cotton linens. The location is great at the bottom of picadilly on Hyde park corner
UR120757713	Stayed here last September, booked a superior room and as Royal Ambassador been upgraded to Studio suite on fifth floor (many thanks to guest relations manager). Regardless of the pricy and poor quality room service food every thing else was perfect. Special thanks for Ms.Claire at the front desk.
UR120750445	I stayed here for two nights on separate occasions during a trip to the UK. We were on a trip from the USA to see 4 soccer matches in 5 days and thus stayed in several hotels all over the country. Regarding the InterContinental, the first night I was on the 4th floor overlooking the courtyard, the room was small but comfortable. The view left much to be desired but it wasn't a deal-breaker. The next visit was two days later, and I received a renovated room on the first floor with a great view of Park Lane. The room had a couch and plenty of room, not to mention it was on the same floor of the spa and the workout room. The staff at the front desk was fantastic, and the concierge folks had some great recommendations for me and my crew. Beautiful lobby, great location within walking distance to two different tube stops and great London sights. Oh, and the beds are amazing - one of my companions actually was trying to check the label on the mattresses to see what brand it was so he can order one for his home. If you can afford it, go ahead and make it happen!
UR120704880	I was in London earlier this month, and I found this hotel for around 400 pounds through a travel agent. I don't know why but all the hotels around that time were extremely expensive, and this seemed like a good deal. Most 5 stars were between 500-600 a night. I got a renovated room on the first floor, which was very nice. The room was nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom, while a bit small was arranged nicely. The staff were very helpful, and the service did feel like a true 5 star. There are two reasons though that I am not giving it full marks. The first is the fact that they didn't award me any points as an ambassador member. They said because I booked it through a travel agent they would award me any points. It wasn't like I was staying for 50 pounds a night, I paid 390 to be exact. The other disappointing thing was the morning breakfast. In my humble opinion, a hotel this large, which they claim is their flagship is impossible to have such a small variety. They only had 2 choices of juices, orange and grapefruit, no pancakes, waffles, french toast, and limited amount of cheeses, and cereals. They also had limited choice of breads, and overall it reminded more of a 3 star breakfast rather than a 5 star. In any case, overall a very good hotel, i would recommend it, but avoid the rate with breakfast as its not worth it.
UR120574973	Stayed here for 5 nights. First the overall impressions. Excellent location, good views depending on your room, stylish interiors, contemporary lobby & bar, relatively classic style rooms, small but very good breakfast buffet, excellent breakfast staff, average bar staff, terrible front office staff. Now in detail. We made our booking directly on hotels website couple of weeks before prior to arrival. Arrived quite late, group of 3, one couple and my self as single room. Booked Superior rooms by the way. An Intern (or a new staff) welcomed us, with someone training her. After couple of minutes on deciding where to put us, she prepared our keys. We said we would appreciate nice rooms as we are staying for 5 nights. She said not to worry, we have very good rooms in deed. Then she gave one room on 2nd floor and the other on 6th floor ?? We made one booking with two rooms and got rooms very far from each other. Well this was the least of our issues. We asked if the rooms are same, she said the rooms are exactly the same so we can choose either of them. I took the room on second floor my colleagues took the room on 6th. My room was an accesible room with a french bed which was just bit smaller then a queen size. They got a room with twin bed on a smoking floor. One of my colleagues has an asthma and she had a terrible night. But since we arrived at almost midnight they did not go to reception and complained. Next day we went to ask for another room for them. Very simple request. Double bed on a non smoking floor. The Front Office staff looked at her computer for about 10 minutes and informed us that she doesnt have any, but we can pay 20 sterling extra per day and get a deluxe room with a view. Not happy, but had to accept. Then she confirmed us that my colleagues will get a king size bed and also a room with nice views. They should just go to their room and wait for the belboy to assist with the luggages. They ended up getting a room on the first floor looking at a courtyard?? we thought this was a joke from Front office and called them. The lady said, sorry her friend made a mistake, they dont have any rooms available for that day, but next day they cangive a london deluxe with 60 sterling extra, but as they made a mistake we only need to pay 40 sterling extra per day. May I remind you that this is an Intercontinental not a Holiday inn express and we have already paid over 300 sterling for our rooms. Luckily the guest services manager took charge and gave them a relatively decent room. As for my room. Very very comfortable bed, good B&O tv and Bose sound system. Large bathrooms considering that its an accessible room ( I have seen teh standard bathrooms and they are tiny) but since its designed for guests with wheelchair, very low baisin, funny toilet and very very low tub. Look I dont mind staying in an accessible room, but just advice this upon checkin and at least offer some complimentary water or something. As there is no space in the bathroom I had to put most of my things on the floor and bend down almost on my knees everyday while shaving. One thing I hate about expensive hotels is when they go greedy. Intercontinental gives you coffee and tea facilities in the room but no complimentary water. As the tap water is discusting, you have to use the minibar water everyday which costs 5 sterling. And I consumed about 10 or 12 waters through out my stay, just do the calculations. Plus 15 sterling for internet. So our extras ended up being just as much as the room price. We could have easily stayed at the Four Seasons opposite. Overall a very nice hotel and it could have been a perfect experience. But its these small things and the staff makes the difference. And not the B&O tv ;) oh by the way, a typical Intercontinental, they spend millions on state of the art tv's and sound system in the rooms and as usual they had a cheap polyester shower curtain. This is an Intercontinental classic that I am yet to discover why.
UR120547310	Stayed there during November with weekend ambassador rate, room was a classic room, very nice but left feeling I wouldn't be happy spending Â£400 a night if it wasn't for one night being free. Great location though, nice bar with great contemporary feel. As an ambassador we had to ask for a late check out and didn't get free water and fruit that you are supposed to get, only minor moan but as we have spent a large amount over last year with them it small things that can matter.
UR120537171	Booked this hotel unknowing via HOTWIRE website. Could not have hoped or wished for a better location and hotel. Doormen - very polite and helpful - dont forget to tip them, they are out in all weathers afterall. Reception staff - the first thing I noticed was that they are all immaculately tailored. Matching jewellery. Pleasant, polite and very efficient. We were asked if we would like an early morning wake up call and newspaper. Decor - is beautiful and in keeping with the hotel everything just feels nice, new and very plush. The lifts are new and well kept and smooth running. Room - OMG beautiful, classic design nothing overbearing, clever with the headboards too. Clean and fresh, top marks to the cleaning staff who worked really hard to leave the room so impressive, neat and tidy. You can tell they have thought about everything in the room for your comfort and leisure. PILLOWS are BEAUTIFULLY soft duck or goose down. I did not wake up with the stiff neck - 'Hello all Hoteliers are you reading this?'. I woke up refreshed and raring to have my shower. You can either have a bath which fills quickly so no hanging about. An over head power shower to die for or a hand held shower, the choice is yours. Compliemtary slippers thank you very much, I wore them and they were just perfect. Complimentary bathrobe (but this has to stay in the room after you've used it). Shower products are none other than beautiful smelling Elmis spa products, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion and hand soap, these little gestures go a long way and make all the difference to your stay. Tissues in the bathroom along with 2 fluffy flannels, towels obviously clean and fluffy. TV screen is built into the cabinet, a range of books to read whilst you are there and for you to buy if so desired. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and warm. Oh and they have air-con if you get too hot or too cold. A couple of chairs if you want to sit and write, shoe brushes, hairdryer, all in cloth bags which were labelled as such. Room safe. A small bar safe (expensive but if thats what you fancy I guess you just go for it). Ironing board and iron. The only sad part about all of this was that I only stayed here for one night!.
UR120343348	With soaring windows offering mind-blowing views of London's Buckingham Palace and the skyline beyond, the revamped Park Lane is the epitome of restrained British style. A vision of old-meets-new, the cool, contemporary design and unrivaled location make it a favorite stopover for jetsetters like Paris Hilton, Scarlet Johansson, and Bill Clinton. The Spa Intercontinental provides a tranquil retreat from the commotion outside. Therapists shuffle through the dim rooms, leading the privileged few to the Steam Temple, a magical â€œArabian Nightsâ€� inspired oasis replete with flickering candles and tropical rain. The spa's minimalist masculine design-smoky woods, dark glass, Wenge panels and Bisazza mosaic-is a refreshing change from the usual ostentation.
UR120246407	This hotel was just an above average business hotel. It was clean, the rooms were a good size (for a European hotel), the beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms are a decent size and it is in a good location. I was on a nonsmoking floor and one night I walked into my room and it smelled like a cigar bar. I called downstairs for assistance and no one picked up, so I had to go down to reception. The night manager was on duty and he quickly offered me a new room and a bell captain to help me move my things. I was in a new room in no time. I was very grateful for the quick attention and to the kindness of the staff. Be aware that averything at the hotel is very expensive ($40 for breakfast, as for the Internet rate before you book the room).
UR120214211	A consistently reliable great stay in London for both business and leisure.
UR120207156	We stayed for 7 nights in a deluxe room on the 8th floor and we really had a very nice experience. I booked via hotwire and I was lucky to have this hotel because I hold an ambassador IC card and I was upgraded to a deluxe. The room was of good size, the bed was huge and very comfortable, excellent pillows, fantastic bathroom with both shower and bath, absolutely clean, with a big balcony all the length of the room, excellent service and very good lighting in the room (I hate rooms with poor lighting). Staff were professional, pleasant and always available to provide information. You can walk to Oxford street in about 15 minutes. On your way back, if you are tired you can either use the underground (Hyde Parc Corner tube station is 1 minute walk from the hotel) or take a bus. Sleeping quality was outstanding and there was no noise whatsoever. Internet costs 35 pounds per 3 days (or 15 for one day). This is the only weak point but it is not specific to this hotel. I do hope that all hotels will soon offer free Internet. Nevertheless I must say that at least the speed was always between 15 and 20 Mbits. I recommend this hotel and I will certainly stay again here when next in London!
UR120033997	excellent location, lovely hotel, although rooms are quite small. All amenities expected in a 5 star hotel, and the best showers of any hotel in London. Friendly knowledgable professional staff in every department
UR120008948	We stayed here for three days in October on a weekend away, the intercontinental is a fantastic hotel in a great location, with excellent staff, and spacious, modern rooms with everything you could possibly need. It is right at Hyde Park Corner tube stop (direct to Heathrow) and only a stroll to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly, Knightsbridge etc. The concierge desk was particularly helpful in recommending both formal and casual dining options. We got a great deal for this hotel through hotwire, so we only paid about 1/3 of the standard rates for the hotel. I can't comment on the food in the hotel as we didn't eat there but there is both a cafe and a Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel both of which looked good. Depending on how active your visit to London is, there is a city bike/Barclays bike stop nearby in Hyde Park which make for a great opportunity to see London by bicycle! I would be more than happy to stay here again, but with my budget I would have to keep my eye out for a good deal! All in all a great stay in London at the Intercontinental.
UR119804878	So after a 14 day trip throughout in London, this was a 2 day stay at the end of our journey. It was so wonderful to be in an American hotel chain for familiar surroundings. It had all the amenities we are accustom to and as said before a great area to catch the tube straight to and from heathrow. Perhaps, if you where looking for more budget friendly eateries or shopping this wouldn't be your first choice. However easy to catch a bus right outside hotel if you know where your going......if ....would be the questions. Concierge was so wonderful and we were able to book big bus tour and tower of London and save us hours of time stuck in lines. So if you score a great rate as we did on hotwire don't hesitate to stay here. But if paying rack room rates and desire more shopping/night life not as super fancy within walking distance maybe consider something different. Looking around hotel clientele all seem on business on company dollar. Overall perfect stay. Just FYI...45 minutes to heathrow on tube and you don't have to change lines. Hyde park corner station is Literally at the doorstep of hotel! Bonus
UR119786554	My daughter and I stayed at this hotel on a short city break, must say very impressed with it , would visit again , the ,staff, location, rooms everything was great.
UR119475480	Visited London for a three day business trip, managed a good corporate rate and enjoyed the stay at this hotel. Its location is very good, south-east corner of Hyde Park, easy walk to Picadilly and Oxford streets. The hotel is well maitained, the staff courteous. The rooms were excellent, with all the right amenities, including the Bose radio/cd/ipod player. Not sure about the B&O tv, a bit small and nothing special, probably a waste of money, better spent on a regular 32" tv. Baths were super clean and spacious. Used the gym once, but the weather was good and ran outside instead. Did not eat inside, so many better options outside, though am told they have a nice Michelin starred place in the hotel. All in all a very comfortable stay, highly recommended.
UR119404907	Stayed just one night, and it was faultless. Bar staff especially impressive, particularly relating to Gin! Tiny gripe about the cost of the valet parking, but frankly it's expected in Mayfair! Great hotel.
UR119364794	I really enjoyed this stay. Great property and great area. It is near Buckingham Palace. The shower was great and the evening cocktail hour was great too. Dont forget to try out the complimentary breakfast.
UR119325313	Can't say enough about the InterContinental. From check-in to check-out, first rate experience. Bar staff was outstanding (martini made from locally distilled gin was a once in a lifetime experinence). Can't wait to go back.
UR119315331	I stayed for to nights. I as upgraded to a Deluxe room which faced the traffic interchange of Hyde Park Corner. Beautifully decorated and furnished, the room was a bit over-stuffed. If two people were sharing the room with a large suitcase each, there might be an issue where to put them. I mentioned to the housekeeping staff that the drain in the tub/ shower was a slow drain, they had someone up to inspect and fix it before I was back from a short business meeting. The bed was very comfortable, unlike some hotel groups that have cheapened it's beds in the UK. ( hear that, Hilton? ) . First rate on all fronts. I'd stay again with no hesitation.
UR119168672	Such an excellent location, handy to 2 underground stations, close to the 2 big parks The room we had was newly refurbished, facing the front. Excellent facilities in the room, fabulous comfy bed. The guys there couldn't have been more helpful particularly the concierge service. It's pure luxury. We got the room as part of a 'secret room' and we couldn't have been happier. We would definitely go back.
UR119165492	Stayed here for three nights on business. The hotel looks recently renovated. The lobby was updated with a classy modern feel. The bar area had a good energy in the early evening. Room was small but typical for a London hotel room. I had no view, just that of an internal courtyard. There was room for improvement from house keeping, on the first day I did not receive turn down service and on the second day they came at 815pm, which in my view is already too late. The hotel is located within relatively easy walking distance of some of the major sights. While the immediate vicinity is lovely and green, it would have been nice if there was a coffee shop or convenience store nearby as the GBP15 continental breakfast is a bit much for even me to expense. I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again for business or leisure.
UR119102801	This is a luxury hotel and from the moment you arrive the staff make sure you are most welcome. I booked a Club Intercontinental room which gave access to the huge Club Lounge on the top floor which has super views over London. It also has a dedicated team in the lounge who are attentive and helpful, whether this is serving food and drinks or helping to arrange transport or give directions. If you are planning to stay here I would recommend the Club Intercontinental. Breakfast is served in the morning, guest are then treated to a wonderful afternoon tea and there are drinks and canapes in the evening. My room was huge with a very luxurious bathroom and a very powerful shower. The bath fills in a moment and the furnishings/bedding/robes are all high quality. I enjoyed this visit so much that I did not hesitate to arrange a further visit for later in the year.
UR119099427	Got a great deal through Hotwire and was delighted with this hotel. Fabulous location and so easy to walk everywhere - did not need to get on the tube all weekend. Room was a little on the small side but it was well appointed and quiet. Agree with previous review - no view across courtyard but really quiet. The bar was a super place to enjoy a Bombay and read the papers. A few minutes' walk away is an M and S for supplies. Beware the mini bar - will charge if you remove an item to store your own goodies. We told the receptionist on checking out and she was utterly charming and took our word for it!
UR118944809	The recently updated London Park Lane did not disappoint. The atmosphere was fresh and modern with the most comfortable bed, linens and pillows any traveler could desire. The concierge was incredibly helpful with arranging a "Fast Pass" to see Buckingham Palace. I was unaware tickets with appointed times were needed to tour, but with the Fast Pass we avoided the long lines to get tickets and were able to tour the Palace upon arrival. And Buckingham Palace is just a short walk from the hotel through St. James Park. Another bonus, the Tube station Hyde Park Corner is located right next to the hotel as well as Hyde Park, itself. The concierge was also helpful in recommending best ways to get to various sitess/restaurants around the city as well as providing train schedules for day trips. A downside was the cost and quality of food at the breakfast buffet, especially if you're NOT an early bird. Items (fruit) are not readily replenished. But then, getting great food in London, with the exception of perfectly brewed tea, provides a challenge to the pocketbook.
UR118940465	It is a nice hotel right across the street from the Four Seasons. The exercise room is good, and the room was spacious for a London hotel. The location is very nice. The only thing that is a pain is trying to find a small shop to get food water and snacks. The area is such a high rent district that you must walk a few blocks. The food was good as was the service. My total bill was astronomical, but you kind of know that going in.
UR118798546	My husband and I travel frequently from the US to London on business, several times a year in fact. We do have a fairly broad understanding of the language regarding what a 5 star hotel in London should be. We do not always stay in 5 star hotels out of choice but decided to do so this time. I should add we have stayed in this hotel previously with disappointment regarding the discrepancy between room we were given versus the deluxe room we had paid for but because of the location thought we would try again. Unfortunately we booked for 5 nights. When we checked in we were looking forward to our deluxe room with a view of the park. I thought there was a mistake, or they were joking in some odd way when they took us to a room on the 8th floor so very small we could not open our suitcases (2) could not exit the room without bumping into the television, mounted on the wall. They maintained that this was a "Deluxe room." I am a fairly short person, 5 foot 4, and could easily reach my hand to the ceiling, practically palms touching the ceiling. It was impossible to open the closet because the only place to set the suitcases, the only floor space, was in front of them. We were successful in getting a new room the second night. We had heard from another reviewer about an experience here with bedbugs, so were not comfortable resting clothes on the floor. There were no racks. We had asked for hypoallergenic bedding when we booked, due to severe allergies and were assured of hypoallergenic bedding.We called to request this again and they didn't know if they had anything, said they would look. In a couple hours the bedding was changed as we had asked. I added my own personal allergy covers on the pillows but tonight they are missing from the bed, taken off to the laundry I would guess. I would like to comment on the breakfast. The first morning, I ended up going upstairs to my room to get my own teabags because the service was nonexistent. There was no toast - no waiter- and no response to my politely asking for some coffee for my husband. The second breakfast was slightly better though we had to ask 3 or 4 different times ( different people) to get any service. The stay has been aggravating, the service poor or indifferent, the food nothing special, the tone of the stay ruined by the first room, my allergies a problem due to the disappearing covers, and the cost, of all this aggravation, extreme. Look for other hotels such as the Hilton or the Park Lane.
UR118583632	Had beautiful recently re-furnished room with everything you could wish for. Service was efficient yet friendly eg had a lovely surprise for my birthday. The only downside was at breakfast where food was good but service terrible! At Â£28 a head, I didn"t expect to see dirty dishes sitting on adjacent tables. No toast ever appeared and own dirty plates took ages to clear.
UR118558451	The hotel had a great interior -very stylish. The rooms are not to big but nice and classy with a great bed. The italian restaurant is great. The bar is a meeting point and always a good atmosphere. The service is very slow and sometimes you even are not served. The doormen make a great work.
UR118432580	i spent a long weekend in the intercontinental london park lane hotel in the summer, when i checked-in they told me they have some issue and they were wrong with some information they gave it to me ,i told them it is not my problem and it is the staff fault they argue with me and keep discussing although that it was there fault, i were really upset and i told them as long as you gave me a wrong info u must let me at lest satisfied they keep argue and argue in the end i had nothing the only thing they were able to do to gave me a fresh fruits and water and guess what they already do that for ambassador ! and they did that for me when i stayed in my previous stay! they can gave me a complementary breakfast, or access to the club, or a day at spa , or a dinner,or complementary mini bar â€¦â€¦etc but they did not although they were wrong !!! beside that i did not get an upgrade and I'm platinum ambassador! on the other hand i acutely asked for staff they didn't give it to me like being in high floor and the tow rooms in the same level and just ignore that despite the facet that i did an early booking so they have all time to find my request. by the way just deal with the hotel by email don't ever call them because all the time they asked for my emails as proof for my request and i have no emails because i was dealing with the hotel by calling them !!! the housekeeping don't put any thing in the mini bar or in the bathroom when it's finish,i most call them or chase them in the corridor so i can get my needs. i acutely stayed many times at ICH london park lane and i knew it is a great hotel and staff !! this time they really disappointed me i don't know what's wrong with them! i have really high expectation since the ICH london park lane know how to treat loyal costumer with all my expiation i was extremely disappointed!
UR118388566	Wonderful stay! Our headline says it all! Right next to Hyde Park and Green Park stations so it's well located to the tube. Next to Hyde Park and very near Kensington, Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus for shopping, theater, food. Would stay there again.
UR118240615	I stayed here for one night, as I got a good rate on Hotwire. The hotel is located just off Park Lane - not particuarly close to a tube station, but not too far away either. Check-in was very easy (my room was upgraded and ready early!) and the staff were extremely friendly. My room was on the 7th floor and faced the direction of Hyde Park. You could hear a bit of the traffic, but it wasn't too bad. The decor was very oldly worldly - lots of dark wood and ellegance. Everything was very clean and there was a kettle (such a nice treat to make your own tea in the morning).
UR118063061	Great hotel stay for business. Picked it up (like a couple other reviewers before me) for sub $200 on Hotwire. VERY comfortable beds, great location, and one block from Hyde Park Corner Underground. Staff was courteous but weren't motivated to find me a Gypsy cab to Gatwick - took the EasyBus instead. Overall - excellent experience.
UR118060249	Pros: location for sure (right in the thick of it), nice (either a 4.5 or 5), clean, good channel selection (Sky sports channels and ESPN for our rugby and soccer watching at the end of the day), great restaurant selection in walking distance, Green Park or Hyde Corner tube stations close by, Bus stop 1 block up at Hilton Con: no free internet, restaurant and bar expensive (to be expected), 2 twin beds were under 1 headboard basically set up like a king (they were on wheels so we pushed the apart), concierge was english as a second language so he was of little assistance and didn't seem to know the area very well (went up to the Hilton and talked to their guys...much more insightful)
UR118001734	We stayed here for one night. The hotel was in a good location and very accessible. I booked on Hotwire so got a terrific rate (less than $200 US/night). However I was concerned that I would be stuck in a smoking room and needed to be in a non-smoking room due asthma and allergies. I emailed the hotel and they accommodated me which I really appreciated. Our room was ready later than check-in time which wasn't great, but it seemed very busy in the hotel. Service was good overall. One thing my husband and I did note was that given the size of the room, the lack of view (we faced some sort of courtyard) and the small bathroom we were really glad we hadn't paid the regular rate. There are some fantastic hotels in London that charge less than the InterContinental and are much nicer with just as good as a location. So, in sum, if you get a deal from Priceline or Hotwire, go for it. Otherwise, you might want to keep looking. It seems you are mostly paying for the name.
UR117979263	[Please note that I listed this review as a "business" trip under the TripAdvisor classification, but it would have been more accurately listed as "business+leisure" if TripAdvisor had provided that.] From the viewpoint of a tourist, this hotel may have one of the best locations of any hotel in London. It is located at the southeast corner of Hyde Park, on Piccadilly Road. It takes only two or three minutes to walk (under Park Lane, using the "subway" - an underground walkway, in London-speak) to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. A walk of seven or eight minutes from the hotel will get you to Green Park and Buckingham Palace, where you can then walk along The Mall to Trafalgar Square. From the hotel, access to the Tube - or the Underground, London's subway (in New York-speak) system - is very good, either at Green Park station or Hyde Park Corner station. Service at the hotel is excellent. If you can afford it, the Club InterContinental on the 7th floor (which would be the 8th floor, in the American counting system) is wonderful. This Club is included with some of the rooms; with others, it can be obtained through a supplemental payment. Be forewarned: this hotel is not for those on a "limited budget." My overall rating is "very good" rather than "excellent" because of the amount of money required to experience this property. One thing that I was surprised and disappointed in at the hotel was that it seems as though Internet access per room is restricted to two (2) devices, such as one personal computer and one smartphone. For the amount of money paid for the room, this restriction is absurd.
UR117806700	this is perfect location, 5 stat hotel that i managed to get under $200 per night on priceline. hotel is very convenient and walking distance from Hyde Park Corner tube on green line. also walking distance from Buckingham palace and most of central London attraction are only few miles away. It is very central and well connected. Room was very clean and comfortable, we were mostly out all day and it was refreshing to come back to the room. Wish they can offer internet connectivity free. It was pricey and charged by blocks of 10 minutes... i don't know why 5 star hotels do this, i have stayed in lower star hotels and they provide free internet which is a huge convenience during travel. Although it is a great hotel but wouldn't recommend you to pay anything over $250 per night. No pool in this hotel which was a disappointment.
UR117747108	I stayed here for only one night and had high expectations of this hotel. I must say that the executive rooms were very well appointed though it was a bit of a puzzle to get everything working. As an Ambassador member I did expect a bit more in the sense of helpfulness and recognition from staff. It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't great either. Everyone was very friendly but it took a few phone calls to get some simple things sorted which didn't give me the sense of recognition I have come to value as a loyal customer to the brand. Unfortunately the room I was in was a connecting room and conversation in the adjoining room was audible. Another negative was the shaking of the bed when the room next door was being cleaned. The walls were very thin. At the rate paid for the stay I cannot say it was good value for money, despite the Ambassador upgrade. Nevertheless I would probably stay again but with more specific room requests.
UR117696766	Stayed here for two nights in June for my birthday, what a treat! The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room size was adequate, I have certainly stayed in smaller rooms in London. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We did not eat in the hotel this time, had a show booked and lunch at The Ivy, but next time hope to try Theo Randalls as we liked the look of the menu.
UR117533545	The hotel is just a stone's throw away from the Hyde Park Corner tube stop and a few minutes from Green Park. For a tourist that means direct access to Heathrow, King's Cross and many central attractions without changing line. Breakfast is perfect, but try booking it with your stay to save money. Our room was a bit noise, but that could have been bad luck (children etc.). Especially with "last minute" booking for 200 Euro per night (couple) good value value for money. Restaurants are close by, and there are a few nice pubs around the corner (Sheppard Street).
UR117408452	My sister and I have just returned after having spent one night in this fantastic hotel. Everything was 1st class including the room, service and friendliness of every member of staff we encountered. We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant and a brilliant breakfast the following morning. My only regret was that we were only there for one night!
UR117369683	My wife and I travelled to London and stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel, Park Lane. Sadly it was only for one night, this hotel is fabulous. But what stood out for us both were the staff, they were polite, ever smiling and could not do enough to ensure the guests were happy. We will be back!
UR117350130	Very nice hotel,friendly staff,supreme area for London sightseeing !
UR117316381	My wife and I stayed at this property August 19 and 20. Holding Royal Ambassador status I was upgraded to a suite with a balcony. The room, service and staff were of 5 star quality. The hotel is quiet, yet central. A short 5-7 minute walk through the park to Buckingham Palace or an easy walk to Knightsbridge, Harrods and premier shopping on Sloane St. An excellent choice for London.
UR117252875	Stayed 1 night needed a hotel close to US embassy for an early visa appointment this was 10 minute walk away. Location is great across from Hyde Park, 10 min walk to Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street, Buckingham Palace. Arrived at 10 am on after an overnight flight from the USA my standard room was not ready but was offered a superior room for $30 extra ( probably a scam as I had booked on Priceline), I paid as I was desperate for some shut eye before my wife arrived later in the day. Room was small but was sumptuously furnished and very comfortable queen bed, a Bose sound system with ipod dock and B & O tv. Rain shower was awsome and great elemis toiletries. Room was turned down after an evening out. An umbrella was provided, useful as our 1st day was 84 and 2nd day it rained all day. No ice machine on my floor but a helpful barman provided me with some. All staff I came into contact with were friendly & knowledgable and made our stay a pleasure.
UR117090750	I have stayed at this property several times after it was renovated in 2007 or so, with the latest stay in July 2011. This hotel has been consistently good and is well set up especially for the business traveller. It is in a perfect location and has reasonably good rooms (the quality of the design is excellent, whereas size is a bit of an issue). The fitness area is of reasonable size and has a good combination of cardio and weights -- more on the cardio than the weights. The breakfasts are expensive and somewhat limited. Compared to other London properties, this offers a good mix of quality and consistency.
UR117034854	We stayed here 4 nights in late July early August and really enjoyed it. The room was luxurious and we slept well every night. We were able to check in early (coming from an overnight flight) which was a major plus. The rooms were cleaned promptly and it was nice to have the turndown service after coming back after a night in London. They also delivered a daily newspaper in the morning. I took advantage of their gym, which was nice. The location is excellent. It is just steps away from the underground. In fact, from Heathrow you just hop on the Piccadilly line and get off at Hyde Park Corner (no need to switch lines). The location is pretty central so we also walked to a lot of places, or took a short taxi ride. Everyone at the hotel was nice. Overall, the stay was excellent. Its pricey, but you get what you pay for.
UR116981086	We stayed at this hotel because my husband was in London for business but I went along for pleasure. the staff gave us everything we asked for....early check-in, extra towels, dinner reservations. The room was comfortable, spacious and very clean. the location of the hotel was good for walking to many places of interest in the city. We would definitely stay here again.
UR116872100	Was here for a conference and had a very reasonable rate for four nights. Large clean room. Extraordinarily comfortable bed. Great linens and pillows. Well appointed bathroom. Although facing Park Lane on allowed floor, the room was quiet. Check in was slow but there were quite a few travelers arriving at the same time. Staff was responsive to requests. Unlike many of my London hotel stays, cost did not detract from the experience and I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I would happily return.
UR116807332	Stayed two nights. Received very nice upgrade to executive room. Excellent check-in from Turkish front desk manager and his assistant. Room with a nice view and very comfortable soft bed. Clean and spacious bathroom and good minibar selection. Paid for executive lounge breakfast. Great canapÃ©s and drinks in afternoon and wondeful breakfast. Amazing service by Marie and her team. Very helpful beautiful blond female concierge and courteous doorman with hat who knew all cab drivers! Housekeeping was friendly and professional, it's not often my standards of cleanliness see met. One of my best hotel experiences in Europe and reconfirms my loyalty to the Intercontinental brand. Will certainly return!
UR116720236	During our last stay, I wrote that I felt we were treated worse because we used reward points for the room. I am not sure if their management has changed or we just had different staff but this was an true IC experience. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. Our room was great and you can't beat the location. I am only sorry that it took me this long to write the review....sorry, an experience like this deserves immediate attention!!
UR116630181	We stopped here for 2 nights. Staff were very friendly and polite. Rooms were clean and comfortable - beds got turned down at night which is a nice touch. Breakfast price was a bit steep so we ate out. But afternoon tea was great value for London - and they kept re-filling the cakes and sandwiches until we'd had enough!!
UR116526921	My wife, daughter and I stayed here August 1-3, 2011, during our family trip to London and Paris. We hopped around to different hotels during our journey and found that the Intercontinental was just a plain ordinary hotel. Nothing too fancy, nothing extravagant except the price. I was actually rather annoyed, because I paid for a 5 star hotel, and would have been much better off spending less money to stay in a 4 star. Everything at the hotel was extra, for example internet and breakfast. The area the hotel is in is so expensive, it made it intimidating to walk around, even if just to buy a bottle of water. The staff of the hotel was snobby, and not really all that knowledgeable. Twice they sent me in the wrong direction. The next two days we switched to the Park Plaza Victoria Station which was literally half the price, and included breakfast and internet, and the hotel was equally as nice, if not nicer. (read my review on the Park Plaza Victoria Station)
UR116515088	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights 29th to 31st July 2011. As Ambassador members we were upgraded from the executice room as booked to a studio suite, which had a splendid view of the Wellington Arch and the gardens of Buckingham Palace. We arrived early at the hotel therefore our room was not ready, we were advised from the front desk that they wished to give us a lovely room with a view, we were advised that we could go to the Club Lounge if we wished to relax have snacks etc., which we duly did. As our room was not going to be ready until possibly after 4:00pm we decided to go out and we were told by the Club Lounge manager that the front desk would ring us when our room was available which they did at about 04:45pm. We got back to the hotel after 6:00pm collected our room cards and when we went to the room, our luggage was there and some nice compliementary nibbles, drinks etc. We found the concierge team especially Michael to be very helpful in arranging tours, restaurants etc. The Club lounge is wonderful as usual, and Maria the evening Manager was very welcoming and friendly. The lobby lounge has been renovated since we were in the hotel last November (we did not stay on that occassion), it is very nice indeed. The hotel is spotlessly clean throughout. We have always found the service level at this hotel to be spot on but this time it was exceptional, and at the same time the staff are very polite, friendly and no way overbearing. We took our breakfast at the Club lounge as usual therefore I can't comment on the hotel resaturant, but if the Club Lounge is anything to go by I am sure it is very good indeed. When we stayed there in March 2010 we ate at Theo Randall, this was extremely enjoyable. All in all we find this hotel to be wonderful in every respect (I am a fan of InterContinental's), the service level has gone up a notch as I said, maybe this is as a result of the re-opening of the Four Seasons accross the road, but to mind the InterContinental Park Lane has always warranted their 5 star rating. The hotels location is excellent for the parks, shopping, Piccadilly, Bond Street etc. We look forward to returning to our London home in the future.
UR116467606	We ended our Scotland and England trip with 2 nights here. What a great way to end a vacation. Our room was excellent - clean, comfortable, with a large tv for my 14 year old daughter and lots of amenities. The water pressure in the shower was even better than my own at home. Staff were helpful and friendly. They tracked down tickets to a sold-out show, printed my boarding passes, and answered many questions. Perfect location, too. No complaints, only praise. This is a 5 star hotel that earns its rating.
UR116383347	all the staff was soo good i stayed saturday night on 06/08/11 and the mangers which was on sunday morning that day was soo nice and would love too goo back again for sure i hope they really get a BIG thank you for our stay being soo good the room was a good size and very clean i loved every bit of it i will be staying again sometime soo with the girlfriend thank you again TIM
UR116134316	we arrived at this hotel on the 20th of july and left the very next day , we were 3 so we took 2 delux rooms , and it was so small that one of the room's side walls were touching the bed , the other room was better but it didn't got a balcony as the terribly small one it felt like a cave . our flight arrived late so we were so hungry and we had to order from the room servies let me just say the food tasted and looked like a homemade food , and we were so dissapointed . it doesn't even feel like a 5 star hotel , it's just horrbile from old Worn-out furniture to dirty bathrroms , i couldn't take a shower when i saw an orange spot on the bath currtens . the locations isn't that good either =\ , well i guess the hotel would be ok if they change the furniter and upgrade their rooms . for the moment i advice you to go stay somewhere elss =) .
UR116127338	The hotel is located near the corner of hyde park. You're close to Hyde Park Corner Subway, Hyde Park, Piccadilly Circus (15 min walk), Oxford Street (15 min walk), Kensington (20 min walk). The standard guest rooms are comfortable. A bit old in style (english), good beds, clean and overall very good. The staff gives excellent service, and you feel that you are very welcome. Breakfast is a bit pricy, but compared to hotel price I guess it's okay. Breakfast was not as good as other 5 star hotels. Could have been bigger choice of things to eat, and service at breakfast was just ok. In total, an excellent hotel for a weekend in London!
UR116117147	It was my 3rd stay at this hotel, I liked the Lobby new look and much enjoyed the high quality service here. The only downside is the room service food, it's pricey and really really below the hotel standard. Special thanks for the front desk manager and her team.
UR116110698	I booked three nights at this hotel through a cruise line for a pre-cruise stay. We arrived early and they did their best to get the room ready as they new we had been on a long flight. I requested 2 beds and the room was made up as a queen. Housekeeping quickly came up and split the beds with new linens. The room seemed a little tight. I went back to the front desk and tried to upgrade, but the hotel was full. The next day I met Dominic Smith, Senior Guest Relation Team Leader. He very graciously listened to my concerns and showed me a room with two doubles that was much larger. I declined only because it was a smoking room and decided to stay where we were. We had a nice chat and I mentioned it was my birthday and we were going on this cruise to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary. After I returned from dinner, I had a half bottle of the very best champagne and a dessert waiting for me. This kind of service makes one want to go back again. Thanks Dominic, you are wonderful!!!
UR115960254	We were very impressed with this hotel. The room and bathroom were large, clean and well appointed. Great location. The concierge made all of our dinner and dancing reservations and even the doorman was fantastically helpful providing us with a map and umbrella as it was raining.
UR115713753	Very elegant hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Room was quiet, well appointed, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. We slept really well which is rare for us in London. Would recommend as a good base for exploring the sights.
UR115712057	We stayed here for one night (Saturday). It was actually a 'Secret Hotel' booked through a website who tell you the name of the hotel after you have paid (keeping the price low). We were so pleased as we paid an extremely reasonable price for a lovely classic hotel. Everything from check in to check out was great. Very clean and elegant with the most comfortable pillows I have ever had! We were on the 5th floor and it was very quiet, although the view wasn't great, we over looked the 'inside' of the hotel on to other rooms, but this didn't bother us atall. Location is good especially for Piccadilly/Mayfair/Buckingham Palace etc, and is easy to get there (Green Park Tube). Will definately return here.
UR115709710	I stayed with my family at the Intercontinental London Park Lane between 8-17th of July, 2011 and I enjoyed every moment of my stay. We stayed in a One Bedroom Suite that was luxuriously decorated and it was quite spacious compared to other hotels in London. Our suite had a separate living room with a sofa bed and that made it accommodate 3 adults in total. The corridors to the rooms, however, are a bit outdated and need refurbishment to go along with the newly decorated rooms/suites. We had access to the Club Intercontinental lounge where they served excellent breakfast, snacks in the afternoon, drinks in the evenings, refreshments and cookies all day, and free internet. The Club had stunning views over Hyde Park and it was very nicely decorated. The staff were extremely helpful and managed to attend all of our requests promptly. The hotel location could not be better, it is within walking distance to the best areas in London (Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Oxford Street, Bond Street, Hyde Park) and it is very close to Hyde Park Corner Underground station. I have no complains about my stay and would definitely stay there the next time I visit London. Emad AbuHendi.
UR115567560	Location very nice. Close to everything. Exceptional big rooms, excellent king-size high bed with a very comfi matrass, staff exceptional, 2-time-a-day housekeeping, enough room in closet, very nice bathroom with replenished soaps, shampoos etc. Breakfast very nice, fresh, with vegetables and fruits, exceptional English tea, magic lobby atmosphere. 5 delux, no less.... recommended for everyone, not cheap though...
UR115422578	If you don't want to do a lot of research when looking for a hotel in London, this property is almost a no-brainer. Located in the corner of Green Park and Hyde Park, it's a short stroll to Knightsbridge or a 20-minute walk to Piccadilly Circus. Good sized room and good shower. But keep in mind that it comes with all the pros and cons of a huge chain hotel. Important to note: no free internet access in rooms.
UR115402637	Stayed for a week at the Intercontinental Hotel on Park Lane in May 2010. Not a cheap hotel (but nothing is cheap in London) but well worth the price. Here is what I liked: + Very central, subway a few meters away, Oxford Street 10 minutes away + Very nice upscale and clean area + Very friendly attentive personal: be it the doorman, the baggage man, the reception, the concierge (thanks for all the restaurant reservations) + Good gym + Theo Randal restaurant: great Italian food (loved those Bruscetas) What I didn't like: - 15 Pounds per Day for internet connection! Most good hotels offer FREE internet connection or at least rates that become progressively cheaper the longer they are (like 3, 5, 7 day passes). It really is extortion as the guests have no other choice! - 5 Pounds for a puny small bottle of water in the minibar? I saw many hotel guests entering the hotel with plastic bags of Marks & Spencer with water bottles. If the mini bar products were not so outrageously and ridiculously expensive, people would consume them more! - The invoice bill had a number of mistakes and it took me 3 attempts to have them corrected.
UR115209067	This is the second stay in this hotel, but also our last. With our points we reserved a room for our anniversary. We emailed the hotel upfront to inform them we had an anniversary. When checking in we were told that we did not get any upgrades as the hotel was fully booked, but that we would get an upgrade for the second and third night. Later that night friends arrived and they got an upgrade (non IHG members). We also heard a couple talking that they got a free upgrade, but we as Platinum members do not get things for free. At night there was a party in the hotel. We heard music till late in the night. We also heard neighbors coming and going during the night, but as we would stay only one night in this room we did not complain. The next day our friends had problems with checking out. They wanted that the bill was charged to another credit card then they made the reservation with. The receptionist informed them that this is not possible. The friends said that they informed the hotel upfront about this and that they got an email from the hotel. The receptionist said that she could change it, but that she was not willing to. My friends asked what this is because it was promised. Then the receptionist told them that they have to show the email and if they can that she will do this, otherwise she is refusing to do her job. The friends showed the mail and with a very arrogant face the lady changed the creditcard, she was not happy. As the reception promised us an upgrade for the 2nd and 3rd night, we had to pack our luggage and the staff would move everything. This is very good service. So we packed everything in the morning. When we asked for our new room keys the receptionist informed us that they are not giving us the promised upgrade. We said it was promised by one of the receptionists. The manager informed us the hotel was not fully booked but we did not get any upgrades. So the hotel promises things and does not live up to them. They also did not do anything with the anniversary. We were at Alain Ducasse and there we got an anniversary cake during dinner. This is service you expect in good restaurants and in good hotels, but service at Intercontinental is not possible! We asked the concierge to recommend a French restaurant. They made the reservation for us but not at a French restaurant, although they said it was French. The food was not good. If the concierge is recommending these kind of restaurants I don't know it anymore. The room is very clean, but that's it. I do not like this hotel at all. The staff has an attitude. You can be lucky to be serviced by the reception.
UR115006719	We stayed for two nights over a weekend and the experience was very disappointing. No acknowledgement of Ambassador status was disappointing but, aside from this, there just isn't a lot to like about this hotel. Staff were really average (except for one Kiwi girl on staff one evening who was great). Doormen repeatedly failed to offer to help with luggage despite us struggling with bags (and despite being an Aussie I do tip generously so silly them!). We had booked a junior suite with a view. Thought the room was pretty ordinary, not much to say. Bed was comfy but that's about it. The concierge was dire. Asked for restaurant suggestions and was actually embarrassed with what he came up with. Went to the bar for an after dinner drink one night and had to listen to staff drone on and on about their personal lives rather than serve customers. Pet peeve but, despite being on a non smoking floor, we had heavy smoking in the connecting room next to us. The smoke was unbearable. Staff comment "yes it is non smoking but people pay a lot of money to stay in these suites so we couldn't possibly ask them not to smoke". They did at least bring us a humidifier which made a very small difference. Overall a really average and very disappointing experience. I wouldn't waste my money, there are far better hotels in London.
UR114787454	The InterContinetal Park Lane, was a nice hotel just over the road from Hyde Park and only a 5 minute walk to the nearest underground station. Although at the time the hotel was undergoing renovations, this did not impact our stay or the overall standard of the hotel. Upon arrival the lobby and reception was very busy, however we were served very quickly by very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The rooms were of a good size, clean and comfortable. They were of a really good standard, offering the small luxury items expected from the InterContinetal. I would certainly stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to family and friends. I would say shop around for a good deal, because in my opinion some of the room rates are a little high, but for a treat it is worth paying the rates for the location and quality of product you receive.
UR114736043	Stay away from this hotel, worst service and food offered by "5-star"! I stayed here for a business trip and was so disappointed with this so called 5 star hotel. Bad points: 1. Food - the food is simply terrible. Breakfast was included and that was the only reason I had breakfast there. The food selection was small, boring and exactly the same everyday. There was no fresh fruits (well, there was a small basket of fresh ones for decroration). Had dinner at the cook book caft and the grilled chicken was black and overly salty. Pizza was horrible too. 2. bath room is so small 3. service is bad and rude. I called the bell desk to help with my luggage upon check out and waited for 40 minutes without anybody showing. I had to take the luggage downstairs myself. Will never stay at this hotel again. Avoid!
UR114699677	My second visit to this hotel. Stayed one night on a Rewards night and was afforded full Ambassador benefits. Upgraded to a beautiful studio suite. The welcome was friendly and all the staff courteous and efficient. Just a great place to stay.
UR114620425	The reopening of the four seasons across the street may be keeping this hotel on it's toes but I'll tell you,it's staying on them. I've stayed in both now and theres a razor fine difference between the two service wise with perhaps more "bling" obviously at the 4S. We had a club room with access to the fabulous club lounge. The welcome on arrival was instant and warm as was the check in process. We were shown to our room and all was explained to us. It was a room high up with a view of Hyde park and down the hall from the lounge. The room was well appointed...however it has a shower in the bath as opposed to a separate shower.This is a sin a 5 star hotel should not make. The club Lounge had many excellent food presentations. The champagne each evening was nice and there was plenty of it. We had breakfast there each morning too and it was lovely.They also have the art of making a fine omlette...always a good sign ;) They have Theo Randals restaurant at which we ate. I thought the food here though and service was a little disappointing.
UR114281566	This was my third stay here, whilst attending a charity ball at a nearby venue, it really is my favourite place to stay in London... Bedrooms are comfortable, quiet and welcoming; and the location is excellent whether you are working or sighseeing with Hyde Park Underground on your doorstep, or a pleasant 20-30 min stroll to Picadilly Circus & Leicester Square, past lovely boutique arcades. (Pick up some wonderful picnic items from the Fortnum & Mason foodhall along the way..) I particularly love the breakfast buffet that really does offer every conceivable thing you could ever want for breakfast! Whilst this is an upmarket place, you will not feel intimidated as the welcome is a friendly and down to earth one - all the staff are lovely. Can't wait to return...
UR114092927	My wife and I stayed at this property on June 15th, a post-cruise one nighter before returning home the next day. I wish we had more time to enjoy the property. You are diefinitely going to pay for the privilege of staying here. Restaurant prices definitely are high. We did the smaller cafe setting for dinner, and the breakfast the next day. Food was fine and staff did an excellent job serving us. I would consider returning, once I saved for a stay. This visit was done entirely with past customer points.
UR113392902	The best and most helpful staff. Perfectly located for tranportation. Beautiful views of the park
UR113263755	Stayed at the hotel as a treat for my girlfriend on her birthday. Wow - what a great choice. The hotel was fabulous, the rooms were great, the service first class and the staff just so very nice. Formal but friendly. Just couldn't fault the hotel. Superb! Oh.........I did book and say it was for my girlfriend's birthday........and whilst we were out of the room, they sneaked in a card, eight huge strawberries and a lovely little birthday cake with a birthday message. Always looking to go that extra mile it seems.
UR113205052	The service, the beautiful classic style dÃ©cor and floral displays, the spacious room with large and comfortable bed, and the location - it is everything you expect from a 5 star hotel.
UR113115231	The easiest task for my wife and I have when we visit London is deciding where to stay.It is always The Intercontinental Park Lane.Firstly the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.The rooms are perfect and the food in Theo Randall can't be bettered.The location is perfect for both shopping,Bond Street being a short walk and sightseeing.I recommend paying for a room that gives access to the 7th Floor Intercontinental Lounge.Here you can enjoy a superb breakfast,afternoon nibbles and evening cocktails all served by some of the friendliest staff you will find in any hotel. We can't wait to return.
UR112456615	I had some guest coming over and I decided to book them at the Intercontinental in Park Lane. The rooms and all facilities were really nice but The hotel should provide free internet for the rates it has. 15 Â£ for 24 hours is too much.
UR109065286	I arrived at the Hotel to be warmly welcomed, we have stayed at ICH Park Lane once before when our experience was average. Well this time they more than made up for it. We traveled for my sons birthday he was made most welcome given a small gift and Birthday Cake. We were upgraded to a larger room. We also benefitted from paying a supplement to enter the Executive Club where again the staff were wonderful. More of the ICH hotels should offer the opportunity of an upgrade to the club without staying in the club room. Overall great room, good size, excellent breakfast and very good choice.
UR108522721	From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff were wonderful! Dominic on reception gave the best in friendly personal service. The room was traditional, totally in keeping with this type of hotel. The bed was too comfortable for words, the best night sleep we have had in a long time. The Intercontinental is a true 5 star hotel in all aspects. Can't wait to stay again!
UR107808987	My friend and I booked blind (through Hotwire) for the latter part of our one-week 30th birthday celebration trip to London, and was thrilled to find out we were getting an Intercontinental, which I've always had good experiences with. The hotel facilities are beautiful - and the staff amazing! Dominic (at the front desk) upgraded our room free of charge upon learning we were there on a birthday trip; we'd also picked up my friend's cousin at the tail-end of a business trip, and were willing to pay for a cot for her to join us, but he waived the charge there as well - so friendly and helpful, and we really felt welcomed and treated well, I can't say enough about the staff. We'd arrived to check-in early, and they easily accepted our bags and let us proceed out on our day, and contacted us when our room was ready. The ONE sour note was the hotel's internet access. We ended up with a very good, slightly more budget-friendly hotel (4*) for the first half of our trip, which provided us with breakfast and speedy 24-hour internet access free of charge - we didn't expect included breakfast at a place like the Intercontinental, but the internet policy at the Intercontinental took us aback - Â£3(~$5CAN) for half an hour, Â£5 (~$8) for an hour, or Â£21 (+$33) for 24 hours. Our assumption is that the hotel caters to many business travelers, who can write off the extra expense, but to us - already splurging on a 5* for a special occasion - even the occasional ponying up for a half hour at a time became prohibitive and curbed us being able to get in touch and make plans with our friends in the area (landline calls also charged, and of course, serious roaming on our cells applied.) In short, for that reason alone I would only recommend the Park Lane only for business travellers (or, clearly, the well-to-do who do not have to keep an eye on budgets); other leisure travellers with a middle-road budget might want to investigate other venues.
UR107805841	I had wondered as we had booked a mystery hotel â€“ would they give us a terrible room. They did not. We were in room 472 which was not big but certainly not small by central London standards. Great big king sized bed, desk, B&O TV, beautifully appointed bathroom and wonderful Elemis amenities. Air conditioning worked very well and was quiet. The room was very well presented and clean. Good amount of wardrobe space and tea and coffee making facilities in room. Location of hotel is excellent â€“ right by Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. Bar â€“ a wonderful lobby bar selling over 25 kinds of gin â€“ I feared this could expensive and we tried a couple. The barman also let us try a small shot of a couple of more obscure gins to see if we liked them free of charge. Great service but as you would expect of 5*central London hotel, bar prices were high. Evening turn down service was appreciated. They also left a birthday cake for me which was really exquisite. We didnâ€™t use the restaurants so cannot comment but the dÃ©cor of them looked great. A perfect stay for a rate which simply was unbelievable. I would book again.
UR106384162	not a beautiful building from the outside in a traditional sense but once you walk through the doors your transported to a world of 5 star opulence,, marble floors, beautiful flower displays, and attentive staff, i upgraded to a view of the park, well worth the extra, the bed though was simply the best i have slept in,, towels and robes by Frette, and the best thread count egyptian cotton sheets.. B & O television and Bose sound system,, fantastic
UR106133789	My Husband and I had a fantastic time at the hotel ,great location ,and amazing staff ,,,,,, I would recommend it to anyone
UR105968511	We just moved to Nantes France from Canada in Feb. So feeling a little homesick for English speaking people we decided to go to London for Easter. On the way to London we had to change train stations in Paris via the Metro. My husband has his wallet stolen on the Metro. ( Yes I know should have known better. I told him to put it away.) So we get to London with a little bit of cash and no bank card, or credit card. We pre-booked our hotel stay with lastminute.com. We were already paid.Thank god! The hotel staff was beyond helpful at helping canceling our credit cards, bank cards and helping us get a hold of family so we could get money wired from Canada.They looked up all the info for all the cards we needed to cancel in both Canada and France . The rooms were really clean and a fair size for a European hotel. We had a king size bed and a cot for our 3 year old, with enough room to walk around. The staff at the front door were always there to help us with bags and stroller up and down the stairs. The only thing I would "complain" about would be the cost of internet was 15 pounds a day. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
UR105495905	it started with the staff at the front counter. a warm welcome .. As an ambassador member they had made an error with my booking and moved us to the club. Thank you as it just made the trip worthwhile. Four nights in the club was fantastic. The staff were very helpful with local ideas , where to go what to see and where we could get a huge amount of washing done at the right price. Doorman etc all very friendly. Thank you for a great few days.
UR105113586	I stayed here for one night as i had a meeting nearby the following morning. What a beautiful property! As soon as you walk in the word luxury comes to mind. I was greeted with smiling, friendly faces. Checking in at reception ran smoothly. Concierge were always there to help. What i like about this hotel as-well as the modern luxury theme, the rooms are still quite traditional. The bed was so comfy, i did not want to get out of it.
UR105110649	I have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions, as the location of this hotel is perfect for London. The staff are very friendly, the rooms are very well appointed, and it has all of the hallmarks of a 5-star hotel that one would expect, but in fairness this should be expected at the rates charged. Being a Royal Ambassador I was fortunate enough to arrange an early check-in, and we were granted access to the Club Lounge whilst our room was being prepared, so we could at least have a coffee. Unfortunately this took longer than expected so I elected to have breakfast and pay the GBP60 charge so we have access for the duration of our one night stay. The Club Lounge is a nice environment, but is let down by slow service and an incompetent chef. I was presented with sour poached eggs - all that I could taste was vinegar, cold bacon, and a shrivelled sausage that must have been cooked the day before. I never did receive my orange juice from one of the waiting staff, who seemed to take my request then go for a break. The afternoon tea experience was admittedly somewhat better than breakfast, but it was all self service buffet style. We did not take advantage of the evening cocktail hour as we were seeing friends, so am unable to offer comment on this. Breakfast the following morning, was a better experience as the cooked English breakfast was perfect, however my wife elected to have the pancakes which were served raw, and to this day we are still waiting for some ketchup! There were a number of families waiting to be seated for breakfast, so be prepared to wait during peak times if you want to dine at the limited number of tables. On check-out the GBP60 charge is in actual fact GBP72 as the VAT element was not quoted, so be sure to factor this into any of the prices quoted by the staff - I found this very misleading to the point of being underhand. I will more likely than not stay at the hotel again despite the Club Lounge experience, but it is very doubtful if I would elect to pay the additional charge for access. Top Tip: Park at the Hilton (W1K 1BE) as there is an hourly rate available (see http://www.ncp.co.uk/car-park.html?cpid=201321&name=Hilton%2520Hotel) otherwise a daily rate of GBP50/day (or part day) applies, when parking at the InterContinental. It is literally only a 2 minute walk away. Unfortunately the hotel is just within the Congestion Charge zone.
UR104806099	www.ourcherishedlife.com After a long flight from Calgary to London, we arrived at the InterContinental Hotel - Park Lane which is a five star hotel located by Hyde Park and close to many of the places we wanted to visit like the Ritz (High Tea) and Harrods on Knightsbridge. They offer daily turn down service where a maid freshens up the room for a second time in the evenings while guests are out for dinner.
UR104157884	Stayed here this week. Travelled to London by car. I had booked a deluxe room, and got an ambassador upgrade to an executive room - but without the club lounge access. Not a problem as we did not have time to use it. The hotel had a great location and had a nice smell to the public rooms. The staff were very helpful which I have found is typical of all ICH's. If you want to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe next door - dont forget to ask the conceirge for a queue jumping, priority pass.
UR103037978	When in London, my goal is to live in the city and not in my hotel room, so my target is to combine location and a decent dose of luxury with excellent value, and in that regard, the Intercontinental excels. Fresh off an attractive freshening, the reception area and staff provided a warm welcome on an early morning arrival when I stepped off the Piccadilly Line from LHR at the hotel doorstep. Early check-in was expedited and my request for a top floor room in a quiet area was honored, even though I'm not an IHG elite and was staying on AA miles. The standard room was quite adequate, the bed extremely comfortable, the bath well appointed and spotless, and the Elemis toiletries of wonderful quality. More importantly, the hotel was quiet and great sleeps provided every night. My rate included breakfast, and I found the variety and quality to be excellent and the service was very attentive and warm....so much so that I really didn't need anything substantive again until dinner. If your objective is all-out luxury there are options that would fit the bill more precisely, but if you are seeking a balance of luxury and value in a central and convenient location, I suggest the Intercontinental to you with confidence.
UR102689036	We booked through Expedia and had a mixup as the room was to be for 3 people and the hotel had showed only 2. But they were kind enough to supply the extra bed for our 14 year old son and waive the charge for the rollaway, as we assumed all was included in the Expedia package for 3. Jana the manager was especially kind, as well as Fatima in reservations. The hotel is extremely elegant, but the staff make it even more so, all so polished and professional. Everyone of them seems to come from a different country, but their are very unified in their attention to detail and service. Very engaging and kind, from the doorman to the concierge. The lobby level is more contemporary, with stunning floral arrangements all in whites, and the rooms more traditional. Very comfortable beds, even the roll away amazingly. The bathroom was not huge, but well appointed. The restaurant is also suburb, with the contemporary Italian cuisine, as was the British tea in the lounge area. The location is beautiful, between Hyde and Green Park, you are neighbors with the queen and you feel like it. Can only say positive things about this hotel.
UR102637705	Stayed there for 1 night and the quality of the rooms was one of the best I have seen. Everything had a touch of luxury to it Great Hotel and excellent location too.Walking distance to Hyde Park, Hyde Park Underground, Harrods, Shepherds Market.
UR102053013	A typical InterContinental hotel by Hyde Park, yet be prepared to pay up to 5 upgrades to get a room with a Park view. The decor is also stanrdard, classic furniture. The bed is large and comfortable, linen and towels are crisp and fresh. Bathrooms are very small and do not have separate showers. Amenities are Elemis, all with 100% artificial preservatives and ingredients The wardrobe space is very limited and the overall feel is crammed. While other InterConti hotels no longer charge for the internet, this one charges 20 euros ! Lobby area and front office have a very austere, cold feel, almost impersonal. At times, some staff may seem also ''robotic''. The hotel does not have a pool and the SPA has a limited range of facilities. Overall. the hotel is ideal for a business overnight, otherwise, not reccommended for leisure or special occasions.
UR102021176	Upon arrival at this hotel you are greeted by helpful staff and friendly receptionists where nothing is too much trouble ! Reception is opulent and the floral dispalys are superb. Our room, 467 was spacious and clean. Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel in Mayfair. The bed, well let me tell you it is the most comfortable bed I have ever experienced in a hotel in the world, even to the point that I contacted the German based company who supplies the pillows and am having 4 of them shipped over! Superb experience, excellent breckfast facilities and service that has exceeded all other stays in London at any other hotel. Well Done and keep doing what you are doing !
UR101919332	The hotel is very well located on the edge of Mayfair and within walking distance of Knightsbridge shopping & dinning. The rooms are well furnished and fairly sized for London hotels. The staff is very friendly and pro-active in their thinking of guest needs.
UR101917827	Was on a leisure weekend with my wife, booked on hotwire. Standard room (very nice, very comfortable bed). Suddendly in the middle of the night, very huge party next door, actually organized by VERY HUGE customers from Middle East. We called reception, who sent security, and then moved us to another room with all care. Manager had time to come and talk to us the following day and did all necessary to arrange our stay in the hotel. Bottom line, OK it's tough for them to kick-off HUGE CUSTOMERS even if they are making noise like hell. But after that, they were very professional. Congratulation for great service
UR101639735	Spent 3 nights in March 2011 at this hotel, which has a great location at Park Lane facing the Wellington Arch, and appears recently refurbished. Staff was generally effecient and courteous, and my stay was comfortable overall. A few unfortunate experiences, which is why it fell short of my experiences with other intercontinental hotels elsewehere in the world and expectations of value paid for its (steep) price 1. Despite a reservation for a non-smooking room, I was given a room on thr 6th floor which was a smoking floor, but on check-in was explained that the room "had been prepared" before I arrived. So while it wasnt stuffy, you cant help remain with a scent of tobacco which isnt really acceptable for a property like this 2. I now recall being asked for my choice of newspaper, but it was never delivered to my room on any day of my stay! 3. On one evening, I found myself locked out as my magnetic key wasnt working. A guest relations staff arrived promptly upon being called, but with a key for the correct room 674 bearing someone else's name which then worked ! I received an apology over a telephone call, but made me really uncomfortable why the key didnt work in the first place 2. and 3. aren't earth shattering, I think 1. was entirely avodiable, and in general I cant help conclude that none of issues 1 thru 3 are acceptable for a hotel that professes to be of this standard, so while a good choice overall I would be compelled to look for other hotels in future at this price point.
UR101397723	Itâ€™s a nice and Very clean hotel, although the double room beds are very small compared to American double room beds, , the beds are half the size of a Queen bed, so you can only sleep 1 in each bed. The bathroom is Very very nice and Very Very Clean, in fact the Hotel is Super Clean in all areas even the Lobby, halls they all look like they are brand new The Staff is very Nice and super professional, I usually empty the mini bar and put my own stuff in there, and then put their stuff back when I check out, and at some hotels thatâ€™s a problem, but not here, I wrote a note that they should not refill the mini bar, and they didnâ€™t ï�Š They got about 50% smoking rooms in the hotel so make sure to book a non smoking, even if you are a smoker, the non smoker rooms are always nicer and cleaner. The location is either ok or excellent, the Tube(Subway) is right outside the door and itâ€™s a 5minute ride to Piccadilly Square, and a 45minute ride to Heathrow airport. If you like to walk, itâ€™s a 20 minute walk from the city center and about 25 minutes from the major attractions like Trafalgar square. So if you want a safe neighborhood close to Buckingham palace and surrounded by huge parks the location is excellent, It all depends on your agenda, if you are like me and like to be in the middle of the City, lights then you should consider the W hotel right I the middle of the London night life, at Piccadilly Circus. btw. Eat your Lunch and Snack at pret a manger its high quality and the prices are fine to, Beware! there are so many Tourist traps like Angus steakhouse and the small cafe's in London, they charge you an arm and a leg, and the food is awful.
UR100975676	Myself and my partner just arrived back from a great 3 day stay at this hotel as we where down for the Chelsea vs Man City match, and it was every bit as good as we expected. The room was nice and had lovely decor, and the entrance to the hotel and main lobby are brilliant. We spent a lot of the night on the friday at the bar downstairs, which was superb and reasonably priced for central London. One of the barman, the Spanish man Marco (It could be another name, I appologise if so as things are a bit hazy), was superb, his hospitality to myself and my girlfriend great and product knowledge fantastic. The room service was good too, most things we asked for not too much trouble. Overall a great stay, location is amazing, most of the staff were superb.
UR100857092	I have just returned from a weekend in London celebrating my birthday with my sister. We were both really impressed with this hotel, initially by the location and proximity to the tube station and then by the lovely interior. We were greeted warmly by reception, and I have to mention in particular Maria, who was wonderful - friendly, professional and a pleasure to talk to. When she realised it was my birthday she arranged a cake to be delivered to our room and also sent a birthday card. Maria is a perfect example of how front of house staff should be and I hope this is recognised by management. I also have to mention Ben who was on reception at night - he was incredibly patient when we forgot our key card and again, as with Maria, acted professionally while maintaining a sense of humour. I have singled Ben and Maria because people are so quick to complain when service is below standard, it is just as important to highlight exceptional service as was provided by these two members of staff. As for the rest, great room, lovely shower, really comfortable bed. A perfect nights sleep was interrupted however by the radio alarm having being set by a previous guest at 0430 am! All in all, great hotel and I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to London.
UR100021619	Following a horrific stay at the IC Malta we were awarded some reward points so we could stay at another IC hotel to restore our faith in the IC brand! The Park Lane did not dissappoint. All the staff were excellent and their customer service and attention to detail was second to none! We were made to feel really welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Dinner at Theo Randall's was amazing, I would certainly recommend anyone to visit. The food was classic rustic Italian, tasted amazing and not over expensive for Park Lane! My trip to the Spa was also excellent. I have travelled all over the world and experienced some of the best Spas (Banyan Tree & Four Seasons) and I have to say the IC Spa was excellent.. one of the best treatments and facilities I have used. My faith is restored and I shall defintely return to Park Lane for another visit. Excellent!
UR99557942	Spent two nights in March there, beautiful hotel, great staff, gorgeous room, expensive champagne, but a brilliant stay thanks
UR99376866	We enjoyed a one night stay at this well located hotel, just a couple of mins walk to Hyde Park Corner tube station. We were upgraded to a room on the 8th floor with a huge balcony which afforded us wonderful panoramic views over London; superb!! The room was lovely with a rain shower, flat screen TV, large mini bar and giant comfortable bed with large cozy pillows - I only wish we had had longer to spend enjoying the room and exploring the hotel amenities
UR98908991	not much to say, great service and location, would go back. rooms really nice. staff couldn't have been more helpful. Only issue is extortionately expensive wifi, ICHG really need to sort this out.
UR97871520	I booked this hotel through a bid at Priceline for $160 per night, which is how I was able to afford it. When I received the information on the hotel, the first thing I did was look it up on Trip Advisor and I was thrilled. The hotel is in a fantastic neighborhood perched between the corners of Hyde Park and Green Park. The Hyde Park tube station is a two minute walk and the Green Park tube station a five minute walk, which gives you a lot of flexibility getting around London. A scenic stroll through Green Park has you arriving on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace. When you walk into the hotel you are greeted by a smiling doorman, white marble floors and crystal chandeliers. There are stunning arrangements of lillies throughout the first level. Our twin room was nicely sized for a central London hotel with a nice sitting area. The linens on the bed were to-die-for as were the beds themselves. They were the most comfortable beds I've slept on in a hotel. The bathroom was comparable to bathrooms in hotels in the United States, with a gleaming granite counter that easily held all of our toiletries. There was both an overhead rain-style shower head and a hand held shower head for quicker clean up. Elemis bath products graced the bath. The room also came with an iron and ironing board (you don't always see this in London) plus a plug adapter and an umbrells (nice touch). We only had breakfast at the restaurant and found it to be very good and not too badly priced for a five-star hotel (Â£14 for a full English breakfast). Coffee at Â£6 was over-priced. The only down note of our three night stay. I would recommend this hotel and stay here again if budget permits!
UR96603711	Recently stayed here for 1 night with my partner and we loved it! Check in was very quick and personable, had a classic king room room on 7th floor and it was perfect. Bathroom not massive but beautifully appointed with a fantastic shower & elemis products. Bed was massive and very comfortable, although the pillows were very soft and there was no firm pillows, still great though! Had a desk work space, separate arm chair with small table, bang & olyfsen tv and Bose stereo. Went out in the evening and when we got back we discovered that housekeeping had entered our room to provide the turn down service, a lovely touch which included leaving a card advising of the weather forecast for the next day! The mini bar had a good choice but was expensive, for example Â£2.50 for a small mars bar and Â£5.00 for a can of coke! We didn't try the food but will next time! Check out was again quick and personable, also whenever we encountered any of the staff in this hotel they were lovely! Room and whole hotel was perfectly clean and well presented. We're definitley going back soon and highly recommend this hotel!
UR96365134	Stayed here for one night everything was fine - although its very hot and stuffy in the bedrooms - there is not relevant literature in the rooms giving information about the hotel re meal timings and facilities etc - briefly looked at the inroom dining brochure which I mistakenly thought related to the times of breakfast - went down for breakfast at 11.20 as I was under the impression it was served till 12 but only to find out it finished at 11.00 - returned hungry back to my room packed up my stuff and checked out - on checking out mentioned the fact to the receptionist that we were disappointed to have missed breakfast and told her there was nothing available in the room giving you these times - she said people usually ask! I replied that ususally there are details available re times and facilities etc she said that USUALLY staff tell you times when you check in - they didnt and the receptionist who had checked us in was standing next to her at the time she had'nt told us - so I said "so the responsiblity lies with the customer then" - she siad 'yes' I told her how disappointed I was, the fact that I had paid for breakfast and now was going to have to go elsewhere and pay again - she was not bothered and didnt have any empathy and was not sorry that this had happened and felt no need to try to sort out our situation - will not be going there ever again -also got charged Â£5 for a small bottle of water from the mini bar and charged nearly Â£7 for service which I thought was laughable as this was applied in a self service buffet style restaurant! Very unhappy with how our stay ended which was spoilt due to poor customer relations and lack of empathy.
UR95803601	Love this area of London,just a short stroll to Buckingham Palace,and the beautiful Hyde Park.Infact whichever direction you take,you end up somewhere great.The staff were very,helpful and friendly,the room was spacious,immaculate and quiet and the bed was the most comfortable I think Ive ever slept in by a mile.Ive stayed in many hotels in and around this area,this was my favourite.Will most definitly return to this hotel on my next visit later in the year.
UR95792117	From start to finish a truly memorable and highly recommendable stay... Very well appointed hotel with an excellent central London location. Lobby and bar areas beautifully designed after a recent refurbishment. Due to my Royal Ambassador status was allocated a 1 bedroom suite with balcony overlooking some of London's most famous landmarks. (London Eye, Big Ben & Westminster Palace) ROOM: -------- 1 Living Room & 1 Bedroom, furnished with wood panelling and overall good design with good fittings. Living room with seating area, coffee table, work desk & Bang & Olufsen TV. Balcony with table & 2 chairs with fantastic views over London! Bedroom had another Bang & Olufsen TV and furnished with similar wood panelling with Bose audio dock. Bed was very large and extremely comfortable. Bathroom was very nice with bath, separate shower, good finishings and Elemis products. Good selection of TV channels & Movies. Mini Bar was very well stocked with champagne and plenty of spirits and snacks. CLUB LOUNGE: -------------------- Breakfast was extremely good. Full continental buffet and you can also order from an a la Carte menu with lots of options (Full English breakfast / Eggs Benedict / Kippers / Pancakes / Waffles and much more) Afternoon tea was very tasty and plentiful. Finger sandwiches included Smoked Salmon, Cucumber, Egg Mayonnaise & Ham & Mustard. And of course there were scones, jam and cream along with other helpings of cakes and pastries. Evenings offerings were canapÃ©s (Brought fresh to your table) with plenty of champagne and alcohol. Lots of staff offering very good service. You never have to leave your table as they would bring you anything you wanted. 3 Apple PC's and Free wifi and superb views throughout. ... Overall one of the best lounges I have been in. GOOD POINTS: -------------------- Hotel lobby & bar looks great after renovation. Location is very good. Fast check in. Check out in the club lounge took under a minute. Service throughout the hotel was excellent. Thoroughly professional & attentive, especially Chrissie & Maria in Guest Relations. Spa was beautiful with a real modern contemporary design and relaxing feel. Had a 30 minute massage which was also very good. Room and the view from it. BAD POINTS: ----------------- Cannot think of any whatsoever!! This was the 3rd time I have stayed at this hotel and am already looking forward to returning again at the end of March. This should be everyone's first choice when coming to London... I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!!
UR94343623	Short and to the point!. Location is great if you like that part of London. Park Lane is known as a high rent district and some of London's better hotels are nearby. The Lanesborough, The Dorchester, etc. Harrodâ€™s is a 10-minute walk. Hyde Park is across the street. Lobby refurbishment has just been completed and although elegant, it's an open design and not very cozy, particularly the bar. We walked up the road to the Marriott Park Lane where the bar is more intimate and much warmer. Breakfast is your standard buffet and of course expensive at 28 Pounds per person for the full deal. The exception is they have someone who makes your eggs fresh on the spot, so at least theyâ€™re hot off the grill. Everything else is out of warmed containers. They do have a very nice selection of other breakfast items at a side table, catering to all tastes. Service was very friendly but a bit sporadic. Manuel was extremely helpful and efficient. Some of the others could be learning from him. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, although it looked interesting and would probably try it next time. The morning action in the lobby hinted strongly at a business hotelâ€¦hence the hefty charges for internet-connection. There was no wireless in our room . We stayed in a Classic King room and had no complaints. The room was decent size, warm and inviting, with a number of small amenities and extras. Room was clean. Bed was comfortable and the sheets especially comforting. Our room overlooked an inner courtyard, but that was fine. We werenâ€™t there to look out the window. They had a very well equipped and comfortable work out room. Although we didn't use it, we took a look and were very impressed. The ambiance reminded me of what the Radisson Marlborough London used to be before they went hi-tech modern. We would definitely stay here again.
UR94133167	At first, and to be fair, I would like to mention that during my stay there was work being carried out in the hotel. That being said, our stay there was terrible! Apart from the courteous staff, the hotel sucks at pretty much everything they do or have. Almost everything was out of order! My initial stay was for 8 nights but I checked out after only three. The hotel initially blocked 2000 pounds when we checked in and then 1000 pounds every night! I was staying at a standard room and I was shocked. After some negotiation they refused to stop blocking additional amounts and offered to lower the amount to 400 pounds. That was when I decided to check out. When I was revising the bill I found that I was overcharged for many of the services I never used. Everything was not working in the hotel. either out of service or having work done on them. First of all, although online on their website they said they had wireless net in the rooms that fact was false. On top of that, even the net through the ethernet cable internet was not working throughout most of our stay. To make matters worse, I had access to the club lounge and even there I was told that the internet was not working properly due to some work being carried out. The point here is not just the poor service but also the fact that I was not advised of this before hand, nor compensated but charged for using the internet in my room. The elevators made loud noises as they came to stop on the ground floor and on several occasions there were lifts out of order or having work done on them. Tv channels suddenly loose service for long periods of time only bbc cnn and aljazeera were working. The scones and cake on the club level were of poor quality. The halls constantly had the scent of paint. The water was full of chlorine even in the shower the smell was unbearable. Although I am a huge fan of IC group but something is off in this hotel. It is falling apart.
UR94029984	I've stayed here for 37 nights between Nov & Dec 2010, booked an (executive room) and been upgraded to (One bedroom suite) thanks to RA membership. Quick review: The suite is very beautiful, good size with 2 bathrooms, 2 TV, Sofa bed. *Best location in London in my opinion. *House keeping service is excellent. *Laundry service is excellent. *Concierge is average. *Room service food is poor!! *Hotel exterior needs improve and more lighting. *Internet is so expensive !! (shame to pay for it!!). *Guests relation POOR. *Front office is good. *Suite #875. (with no view).
UR93220445	The hotel did not look perfect from outside but inside the rooms were very nice and never a problem apart from some delay in answering the tel call from the reception and room service and ,not really nice, a high price for the internet connections . Breakfast was very good and with great choice. So no problem with the hOtel, but what we have found perfect was the position. Max 10 minutes walk from every interesting site this side of the Thames. Great choice !
UR92479266	Very comfortable hotel in a great location - walking distance to plenty of sights and the underground station. Staff was good. Did not try the hotel food because there were lots of great, reasonably priced restaraunts nearby. This was the best I slept on my whole 2 week trip to the UK. I think we paid a very reasonable price (priceline).
UR91943289	Whilst our stay in London was for only two nights, the employees of this what I would call as luxury class hotel were extremely helpful and courteous, we sampled the club floor and found the afternoon teas with the view towards the back of Buckingham place to very nice indeed and also the surrounding areas. We had very easy access to all the shopping areas and the theatres. I would certainly recommend this hotel again, just one small note here though whilst the parking fees are a little high at this hotel I would recommend the "Vincipark" for parking between Hyde park and the hotel, the rates are half the price but with a good all-round security.
UR91620742	Spent a week-end at this property with friends and found the service at check-in, bar, room service and, particularly, the concierge to be exceptional. Rooms were also modern and well appointed, good gym and overall nice "feel" to the place, and all of that at a prime location. Have stayed at several of the top hotels on Park Lane over the last years and rate this one highest overall.
UR91578426	Stayed here for free on points to visit the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland (for the second year on the trot). Rooms are lovely and very comfortable, and staff are wonderfully attentive. Breakfast is pricey at Â£24.50 for the full english buffet, but if you're staying for free, then it all seems good overall value! I probably would not pay the full rate to stay here, as there are some many other things I want to do with my money, but if money was no object, then this place would be my hotel of choice. You really cannot go wrong here!
UR91467352	I stayed here for my 30th birthday using my Priority Points and I guess I came to this hotel thinking "wow, this is THE Intercontinental on PARK LANE". The names "Intercontinental" and "Park Lane" made me expect a really exceptional place, that's why I chose it out of all the other hotels in London. I must admit, when I first arrived at the hotel at the front doors, I honestly thought I was at the wrong entrance (or even the service entrance) as it didn't look anything special like I am used to, staying in many different hotels around the world with my job. Once I had worked out it was the main entrance, the door men were very welcoming. The reception area was very clean and white, but there was nothing special about it. There were no big ceilings or a nice lobby. Just three desks in a row. I was a bit underwhelmed. The room was very nice. The bed was really comfortable and big. Not much of a view. Just looking out to another building across the road. The room was clean and neat, though "cosy" in size. It's everything you'd want in a typical hotel room. I'm the sort of person who usually goes straight to the information book to see what this hotel has to offer.... There wasn't one. I looked in every drawer and cupboard with no luck. It wasn't until after about half an hour that I noticed it in the TV menu. It was not very detailed and I'm sure people would struggle using the remote control to get through the menus. I was after an ironing board, which I couldn't find in the room, so once I worked out I had to request one, housekeeping brought one up straight away. At first I was a bit concerned that I wouldnt get my shirt ironed for dinner that night, but crisis was over. The location of the hotel is good. It's not the most central to a business person or tourist, but its definitely not in the middle of nowhere. For the price, you probably could get somewhere equally nice, much more central to the big attractions. I was waken up by someone trying to get into my room at 9am the following morning. It was lucky I had the door locks on, otherwise I still would have been in bed when someone walked in. I assumed it was house keeping, even though I had requested a late check out as I wanted a sleep in. I reported it to reception on check out and they waived a very expensive packet of nuts I had used from the mini bar, which was nice... but in the end didn't get that sleep in I was after. If i was to suggest two things to the management.... one would be to re-introduce a book/folder of hotel information for guests. As modern and high tech as it is going through the menus on the TV, I'm thinking guests could find this complicated at first and there is not as much detail as expected about the hotels services. The second would be to improve the appearance of the main entrance to the hotel. Even a sign above the door saying the name of the hotel would be good. The entrance is not on Park Lane, so a sign or something might be useful. People reading this review may think it's a very fussy review, but please keep in mind that I booked a night in this hotel with very high expectations, especially with my experience with other intercontinental hotels. It was still a very pleasant stay. The staff were very nice, the hotel and rooms were very clean and neat. I would absolutely recommend people stay here and you wont be dissappointed. All I would say is that you don't have extremely high expectations like I did.
UR91441765	The location of this hotel is superb. Just a short walk down Picadilly, and you hit a Marks and Spencer, a Starbucks, and a Pret a Manger if you are looking for some cheap eats. A few more minutes and you pass a lot of great shopping including Fortnum and Mason and Jermyn Street and then Picadilly Circus. I am used to traveling in Europe and experiencing small rooms, but this room, although very comfortable, was a bit small for the price. The service and attitude of the employees from the doormen to the restaurant waitresses was fantastic. I did not try Theo Randall, so I can't comment on that. Here are some tips: To get to the nearest Tube Stop (Hyde Park Corner) make a right out of the hotel and another right so you walk around the side of the hotel. You will go into a subway (not a subway train but a British subway which refers to an underground passage) straight through and up to ground level again. Keep walking and then you will go underground in another subway and in this subway follow the signs to the Tube. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant is pretty decent with a good selection of cold and hot items. It's pricey at 28 GBP but if you tell the front desk ahead of time they can add it to your room for 20 GBP. Check to make sure that breakfast isn't included first. Internet access is a whopping 15 GBP for 24 hours but you can go into a Vodafone store and get a USB Mobile Broadband dongle for 20 GBP. This dongle comes with 3 GB of data (more than enough for a few days or even weeks) and lasts 1 month. You can also get similar sticks with a little faster internet speed from Orange or O2, but my research found that Vodafone's was the cheapest. I just got a notice (I'm currently writing from the hotel) that remodeling of the lobby begins tomorrow until the end of January 2011 which moves the restaurant (not Theo Randall) and other lobby amenities to suites upstairs, so you might want to take this into consideration if you plan to stay in January 2011. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. Concierge was also very helpful especially as we were here for New Year's Eve and wanted to watch the fireworks but not battle crowds since my wife is pregnant. They gave us multiple options and we ended up with one of them (in front of Buckingham Palace).
UR90812843	Good hotel in a good location. Striking reception area, comfortable elegant rooms. Room service arrived promptly and was of a decent standard for room service. Would recommend this hotel.
UR90108958	I've stayed here a few times. The first was so awful that I didn't come back for three years; the next two were pretty good; this one was terrible. A few weeks ago, this IC earned a spot in my heart for waiving a cancellation fee despite me cancelling late. I decided to reward them by booking a stay in mid-December at almost Â£400 a night. I've got a Royal Ambassador Platinum card so I expected my preference for a quiet room with no connecting door to be honoured. When I got to the room, it had a connecting door. I rang down and was told that I would need to speak to the Rooms Controller who would call me back. 20 minutes later and there had been no call. I couldn't get unpacked or get ready for dinner. I called back. "Why do you need to speak to the room controller?" asked an almost hostile voice. I explained. "Reception can help you with that. Hold on". I poke to reception. It was 7pm but I was told that the only other room available was a twin on a smoking floor: obviously untrue since guests continued to check in throughout the evening when I passed through reception. Translation: "we can't be bothered to change the room allocations". Obviously, the person in the connecting room had a persistent cough and I got very little sleep The fan in the room's heating system was broken (and very noisy) but that was fixed while I was out. It took two phone calls to get non-feather pillows (which are on my profile) If this is how they treat their top-tier cardholders, I can only imagine how they treat the rest. Breakfast costs a minimum of Â£35 and a one-minute call to a UK landline will set you back Â£3. Quite appalling. The rooms are small but quite comfortable. The gym is really very good and quite exceptional by hotel standards.
UR89215739	I haven't a clue what a 'stay with Priority Club points" involves but I did enjoy the stay at the Intercontinental London regardless. I stayed 4 night end of November (Thanksgiving for those from the States). The room was a "classic" room and so a smaller room with a view of the courtyard (no view) but given the general lack of sun the lack of a view wasn't much of an issue. The smaller rooms are a good size room and equal to most studio apartments in London (or so I was told by a local). The location was ideal as the underground was near and the area was nice. If traveling from the States some preparation will make the trip and the stay more pleasant. Acquire the Oyster card in advance for the mass transit as you can take the Underground from the airport . Acquire a convenient map of London in advance or a app on your phone for mapping as the only maps of London are quite large. Ask the mini bar be emptied immediately so you can shop up the street for drinks and snacks. I must admit some issues appeared to be lost in translation between "5 Star" and common sense. I found no information on the hotel services in the room so I was a bit lost on how to address common requests. I asked three staff for a razor over a course of 4 hours prior to the delivery of a razor. I asked twice for the mini bar to be emptied. I always used the two towels in the room but never received more than two towels. No lack of staff to turn down the bed each night, though. The breakfast buffet was a wide assortment of foods to accommodate a wide assortment of visitors. Breakfast starts at 6:30 AM and I suspect the quality is highest at 6:30 AM so wake up early. In a 4 night stay breakfast was buffet two mornings and room service two mornings. The quality was equal but the quanity was not equal. The room service pancakes were an al a carte size at best, as an example. So stick with the breakfast buffet or order the continental breakfast and the pancake breakfast. The gym was very nice and located on the second floor. The main entrance was under construciton so no grand entrance during my visit. The hotel bars and restaurants are very popular. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The TV channels were very limited and included endless sports channels. BBC with the same shows repeated time and time again. The doormen were cute and very friendly so a nice entry and exit to the hotel day or night. Internet was 15 pounds so I paid nearly $100 USD for 4 days of Intenet. Internet should be at no cost at all hotels! I used Internet extensively to communicate and plan.
UR88904609	with renovations going on downstairs, the reception area is a bit messy but that should be sorted out soon. we like the IC Park Lane very much. great service great location wonderful rooms club lounge is one of the best for any IC
UR88332883	We stayed here (again) on Priority Club points, about a year after our previous stay. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (3.45 pm) but we were offerd a drink and the receptionist contacted us when the room was ready. We were given a small suite which was very well-appointed with a bigger bathroom than the room we had had the previous occasion. All spotless. What I remain impressed with in this hotel, given its location and how busy it seems to be, is that the staff are pleasant, helpful and anxious to please. This is a credit to them and their management team. Now if only they could infect the staff of the in-house Theo Randall restaurant with their enthusiasm and professionalism. We booked there for 9pm and hoped to have the prix fixe menu, which wasn't offered. Our food was good, if not sublime, but the staff seemed distant and over-formal. The bill was Â£150 for two and no-one seemed particularly grateful for our business. I would return to the Intercontinental but would give the restaurant a miss.
UR87964035	We stayed with our Priority Points for a birthday. Although the room wasnt ready when we arrived, the friendly front desk agent took our mobile number and promised to call us when it became available. Which they duly did. That set the tone for the whole stay. Front desk staff were infailingly polite. Housekeeping staff acknowledged us throughout our visit and the bar staff were chirpy. We were so lucky with our room allocation and had a splendid room with views across the Park and to London Eye. A large bathroom with Elemis toiletries and a fast-filling tub with plenty of hot water. Our room was classically designed so easy on the eye and with enduring appeal. All was well-maintained. Really cant speak highly enough of the hotel A charming birthday acknowledgement arrived to the room and really made a special trip become extra special. The following morning work had started on the lobby in terms of some type of refurbishment. Plenty of staff were available to help us find our way around (Reception has re-located). Luggage was happily stored whilst we took in the last of our trip and home we eventually went. I cant speak highly enough of this hotel. Well done to all....and thank you very much !
UR87762796	Booked twin bed superior room. Upon arrival, receptionist said none were available and did not offer an alternative. After further telephone conversation with her colleague "Tim" I was offered a room that was out of service due to a broken in room safe. After checking into the room we found other problems -- toilet did not flush, sink did not drain, burned out light bulb at bedside. Our late PM arrival had my wife and I rushing to dinner at the hotel's Theo Randall restaurant so we lived with these deficiencies until the following day. $180 bought us two salads, two glasses of wine two mains (all at the lower end of the price list. The demeanor of the maÃ®tre d', server buser was interesting. It was as though Eric Von Stroheim had trained them as martinets for of his films. They were uniformly distant, imperious and unsmiling with that kind of bearing they better get the food and drink order straight, which they didn't. They brought one glass of wine instead of the two that were ordered and delivered the same entrÃ©e for both of us although we had ordered two different entrÃ©es. One of the entrees was way below standard and returned to the kitchen. A final insult to all of this injury is the restaurants adding a charge for a charitable contribution made in hotel's name. On a final note, the flushing mechanism for the toilet is located behind and below the raised lid and seat so it is necessary to lower them for each flush.
UR87646379	Good service. Ambassador lounge is excellent with great view and good breakfasts and evening drinks. Good rooms - great showers, comfortable beds. Location convenient for Hyde Park tube station and very close to bus stops.
UR86279706	The address says it all, and explains the price of the room. The hotel is located on the corner of Green Park and Hyde Park, facing onto Park Lane, although the entrance is on Hamilton place just behind. Compared to its neighbours, this hotel has been tastefully renovated over the past couple of years, giving the building a very modern feel to its interior. The rooms are by no means vast, but are not small by London standards. My deluxe double room (the same size as the standard, but face outward instead of into the central courtyard, and have a few differing furnishings) had a king size bed, with a couple of armchairs, writing desk and a flat screen TV in the bookcase. It had an adjoining bathroom/toilet of reasonable size. The hotel has the typical overpriced 'celebrity restaurant', in this case Theo Randall, in house restaurant, and a club lounge on the 7th floor that overlooks Green Park. The staff in the hotel very polite and helpful. I stay here on business, as I feel it is one of the better Park Lane hotels, however I would find far more reasonable priced hotels should I be here with my family.
UR86051554	My wife and I stay at Intercontinental hotels a lot and we spent 2 nights here Halloween weekend. In general you can count on a nice well-kept room and good service at an intercontinental, but the intercontinental hotels vary in getting the 4 vs 5 star bits right. Our room was nice (a superior room with a park view). I love the non-fogging mirror in the shower that allowed one to shave in a steamy bathroom. The staff was friendly and we had a nice stay. The elevators were fast; we stayed on the top floor and never had a long wait or a ride stopping at ever floor. The location is fine for some shopping, but is away from the Theatre district and the active part of town. The small things that irked us for an expensive hotel were the turn-down service did not leave a sweet treat, neither the soaps nor shampoo etc. were replaced or additional ones put in the room each day and there was no complimentary newspaper (or if there was we were not advised of it at check-in). Otherwise, a nice luxury stay.
UR85338914	I needed 2 rooms for customers and me and found a fabulous rate with Hotel Pronto which I got from a link on the Travel Supermarket website. I'd have never paid the Â£350+ other sites and the hotels own site were offering. The location is brilliant. Right on the corner of Piccadilly and Park Lane. Everything about the hotel is right for a 5star in central London. While I was there some Sheik had a corridor on my floor to himself with a personal bodygaurd to stop the rest of us wandering down outside one of his bedrooms. That should tell you something about both the standard of the hotel and the clientele. My room was small but perfect. I asked for quiet room with feather pillows but without a view and got it. Silent so slept well. I also asked for late check out which was not a problem for them. Being a persistent (others might say frequent) traveller, I have seen pretty much everything go wrong. So I called the hotel a couple of days before to make sure the booking agent (Hotel Pronto) had done their bit. I was unahppy to discover the hotel had no record of the booking. There then ensued a blizzard of mails and calls between me, the agent and the hotel which only culminated with confirmation from the hotel on the day of the stay itself. The lesson for me is - if you want a cheap rate from an internet agency check and double check early on that the reservations actually reached the hotel. I will defintely go back if the price is right or someone else pays.
UR85095927	Staff was great going the extra mile to provide great service. Location is ideal for those interested in walking- you can see all the major sites of the city within 1 hour. The rooms were very clean the beds comfortable and they were helpful in holding some luggage for 2 weeks prior to our visit at no cost and going out of their way to help us after 2 weeks doing a medical mission. They have a great but expensive high tea and a wonderful chicken Caesar salad in the bar. Overall a wonderful experience.
UR84527108	Great location at Hyde park corner, perfect for a tourist trip or a business trip. Managed to do 4 meetings in they day that I was checking out and still left for the airport by 6. Very convenient. The staff is pretty good and very chatty. Had the great time checking in with the Italian receptionist who recommended a holiday destination in Italy. This is one of the things that I really like about the intercon, the staff have a life beyond the hotel and a horizon that is broader.
UR84455153	I stayed for two nights at the Intercon Park Lane. As it was my first time in London in quite a long time, I appreciated its location. It was easy to walk to Piccadilly Circus and the tube stop was around the corner. The tube stop, Hyde Park Corner, also goes to the airport. I also felt safe walking in the neighorbood. I walked back once from Marble Arch back down to the Intercon at night and there were plenty of cars and people. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are nice. I was upgraded to a superior room as I am a Platinum Ambassador. The room was a decent size and the decor was modern and fresh. It had a nice flat screen television. Internet access was available for a fee and so was breakfast so I opted to go out to eat and use the internet at cafes. During the first night, as I was quite exhausted from the overseas flight, I was awakened at 2 or 3 am by what sounded like a jackhammer. Thinking that it was coming from outside, I looked out the window. Not seeing anything, I opened my door to understand that someone was polishing the floor in front of the elevator bank. Although I was at least 6 or 7 rooms down from the elevator bank lobby, the noise was enough that it woke me up! I called downstairs and was told that the night cleaning staff was polishing the floors (who polishes floors at 3am) and that they would ask them to stop. I believe I must have been the only person on the floor because no one else came out of their rooms. After 20 minutes, the polishing/jackhammering was still continuinng so I called down again and was told that it would stop. Again, the elevator lobby is not that big -- how long does it take to polish the floor? I waited another 20 minutes and it didn't stop and at this point, I became very annoyed and called again and it stopped shortly thereafter allowing me to fall asleep around 4 or 5 am. I would have ranked the hotel lower if I had not received exceptional customer service following this incident. I was awakened the next morning (around 9) by one of the managers who apologized for the inconvenience and offered to move me to another room away from the elevator lobby. When I stated that I did not want to pack my belongings or go through the hassle of moving, the manager offered to send someone up to help pack my belongings and move me. When I returned home later that evening, I picked up a key card to my new room and was surprised to see that I had been upgraded to a suite and given club room access. The bedroom was sufficiently removed from the hallway so that I had a excellent night's sleep. My only regret is that I did not have more time to enjoy the suite. I was also credited points for this stay. The end result was that I left the next day refreshed and quite satisfied with the service that I had received. I understand that customer service at hotels can be hit or miss. I appreciated the fact that the management recognized that I had been inconvienced and made it right. Sadly, I know I will not receive such attentiveness every time I travel, but the management's response made my stay enjoyable and I would return to this hotel in the future.
UR84190059	We stayed here in October, 2010 for a couple of nights. Overall, it was fine, but the hotel bills itself as a 5-star place. It did not match the quality of other 5-star (or even other 4-star) hotels that I have stayed in, especially from a service perspective. The stay got off to a bad start. We arrived around 10:30p. Upon arriving, we were not offered assistance with our luggage as we entered the hotel's lobby, nor was the door held for us (I'm fine with that at a Hampton Inn, but this place bills itself as five-star. Walking in the door without being greeted or offered luggage assistance would not happen at, say, the Four Seasons). Our check-in experience was not pleasant. The clerk barely spoke English, and she was only half engaged in our check-in because she kept inserting herself into the check-in happening next to us (where the guest was complaining). This kept up until her colleague working with the other guest silenced her, saying, "I've got it." I am a Platinum member with Priority Club, the loyalty program of InterContinental. As such, I expect that, like other hotel chains, I'll be treated pretty well during my stay in thanks for staying with the chain a lot. This includes my room and reservation preferences being honored. I had requested, using award points, a non-smoking room with one king bed. My room preferences call for high floor, away from elevator. The clerk attempted to check us into a smoking room with two double beds on the first floor -- I can understand that the hotel might not be able to meet the high floor request, but come on: a smoking room with two beds, when the reservation is for a nonsmoking room with one bed? Give me a break -- awful for ANY guest, particularly bad for a guest who's in the top-tier of your loyalty program. When I raised this issue with the clerk, she began this whole line of saying, "well, you're here on points," as if using the points I'm awarded by the hotel chain makes me some kind of second-class citizen. When I pressed for a better room, she began to talk about how full the hotel was, etc., but then when I refused the room I'd been assigned she magically found a king room, non-smoking, on a high floor! (Magic!) I then had to endure a lecture from her about how "lucky" I was to get such a nice room. Spare me. Obnoxiously, upon check-in I was also offered the chance to access the hotel's concierge lounge. For 95 British pounds a night! 95! This doesn't really bother me -- I wasn't expecting lounge access because I know InterContinental to be stingy with it, but it's in such contrast to a stay I had at a Hilton property in London only a few days before, where -- despite staying on points (gasp!) -- I was put, with the hotel's compliments, on a concierge floor, given access to an amazing lounge, and my room preferences were met. All without having to ask. Makes clear which loyalty program I should stick with -- Hilton made clear its priority was customer satisfaction, while InterContinental made extremely clear through the check-in process that its priority was revenue. Admittedly, the room to which we were assigned was very nice -- elegant furnishings, high-quality finishes, a fabulous view of Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, etc. It was tiny, however -- cruise ship size. The bathroom was very nice, with a great rain shower. Linens were also very high quality. After our late arrival and lengthy check-in experience, we ordered room service. It was a rip off, which I've come to expect at hotels like this. I was willing to pay for the convenience after a long day of travel. The food, however, was awful. We both ordered sandwiches that came with French fries, and after waiting the standard half-hour for delivery, we were given ICE COLD French fries. Literally no heat on them at all. The sandwiches were mediocre. This was bitterly disappointing -- like I said, I've come to expect rip-off room service at places like this, but if you're going to charge $25 per sandwich and fries, then serve them hot. Hardly "5 star." The hotel's other facilities were fine. Nice lobby, interesting decor. The fitness center had a good range of equipment, but only two televisions that got about two channels each because of satellite troubles. No natural light in the fitness center, either. Service throughout the stay was hardly five-star. The bellmen at the hotel's main lobby inconsistently opened doors and generally had nothing to say (only one was good about saying "good afternoon" or "enjoy your day"). Check-out was fine, as was the process of getting a cab. Location is good for many London attractions; the Tube is next door, Hyde Park is across the street, major (expensive!) shopping close by, etc., so no complaints on that front. The neighborhoods surrounding the hotel are ritzy, but lovely, and despite the concentration of wealth in the area you can find a variety of restaurants and cafes. Overall, I would not return to this hotel. The regular room rates are very expensive, and the level of service doesn't justify what they charge. I didn't feel particularly well taken-care of, and I've had far, far better service at many other properties, including in London.
UR83462400	So, first just to establish a little credibility for this review: I am a frequent traveler, and maintain a Priority Club Card with the Intercontinental Hotel Group, and have stayed in over a dozen of the groups hotels, which include Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Crowne Plaza, etc. So, I have a good sense of what to expect from an Intercontinental Hotel. So, the positives: pretty good sized rooms, and (for London) very comfortable (although still a pale shade of the Interconti hotels in NYC). Staff at check-in were friendly, no wit time, and my room was ready even though it was early in the day. The negative: despite being listed as one of the features of the room ( along with TV and walk in shower), the high speed Internet at this hotel is not included in the room rate. Okay, you might say, but here's the kicker...Interconti is the 5 star hotel level for the group....if you stay in their 3 or 4 star hotels, the Internet is free. I found this to be strange...why give away Internet in the low end hotels and charge in the top end? So I went and asked reception. the receptionist asked me to fill in a customer survey, and explained that this is a frequent question, and that many guests complain about this... So I asked to speak with her manager, hoping he could shed some light on the situation....and he did! He told me that guests at the Holiday Inn are more price sensitive, and those that stay at the Interconti are more willing to spend the approx 20EUR for 24 hrs of Internet, without it outing them off their stay. What? I asked, did he mean that because the guests at the Interconti were willing to pay more than the guests at the more budget hotels in the group, that they were being charged more for the same services? He said yes, in his personal opinion! This hotel needs to provide free Internet. Or at least teach their staff not to answer questions with a PR nightmare of an answer. I'm writing a complaint to their customer service department, and will keep TA posted on whether or not they take responsibility for this issue or if I get snowballed.
UR83089922	Very nice hotel. Nice and quiet rooms. A bit poshy and silent, but only a short walk to Picadilly, and the rest of the town-centre. Actually it's faster to go by feet than taxi. Very nice breakfast. About one waiter who has responsibility of about for tables. So you always have great service. The bar actually had four different local beers (microbrewery). And a large range of liquor and wine. In other words a quite nice bar:)
UR82911722	The check-in was very fast, however when we got into our room we realized it was too small considering we booked a deluxe room for $500 per night. The room was very crampled and we needed to have an extra bed which took the management quite sometime and it became more cramp, the breakfast was not 5 star it was the same food everyday and it wasn't nice. For the up side, the view from the room was Hyde park which was very scenic. The location of the hotel was near to Hyde park, green park and Buckingham Palace. There is a hard Rock cafe beside the hotel with a small gallery inside which was fascinating. The tube is also on the vicinity, but it takes about 15-20mins to walk to oxford street and picadilly circus.
UR82492883	My wife and I used Priority Club points for a 3 night stay following a business trip to London. We have stayed at numerous hotels in the area over the years but none of them even come close to the Intercontinental Park Lane. Even though we used points we were treated like a VIP paying customer. The service, from the doormen to the housekeepers was outstanding. The rooms are some of the nicest and largest we have stayed in in London-more like a high end American property. We had a standard king on the Club Room level and can't say enough about the quality of the furnishings, the bed and the bathroom amenities. This hotel can be pricey if you pay the full rack rate but if you can afford it, it's worth it
UR82109282	This is pretty much what you would expect from a business-oriented hotel in a big city. Efficient staff. In particular, the concierges were very helpful. We had some drinks several nights in the bar. Of course, they were expensive, but what do you expect. The location is great -- at the end of Hyde Park, across the street from the Wellington Arch. Tons of restaurants are a short walk or taxi away. The tube station is across the street. We did a lot of walking -- back from the Portobello Road area, and also to and from Covent Garden. Harrods and the Victoria and Albert Museum is a short walk. We had a fantastic, comfortable room in excellent condition right on Park Lane -- it was fun to watch the traffic, and the sound proofing was nearly perfect. They also have a nice and well-equipped fitness room.
UR81922180	As part of our trip we booked one night in the Intercontinental hotel by spending some Priority Club points . It is now our 3rd time here and we checked in early ( 10:00 ) with Kissy . She was EXTREMELY friendly and wanted to give us a bigger room because it could get small with the extra bed . But it wasn't ready for 2 hours so we took the Superior room that we booked . The rooms are always small but they have a style ! Really small doors when entering the room can bothersome . The room was small and had a good bathroom with rain shower in the bath, a sink and a toilet . The room had a fantastic high bed with a big B&O TV with a heavy remote . Also a Bose player was in the room . We had a kind of corner room so we could look in the room next to us and had a small view of London ! Every time you enter or leave the hotel, doors are opened for you by the doormen ! In the evening you get turn down service and they make up the bed, lay a mat for your shoes and give a weather card ! What a service The next day we went to the Concierge . I don't remember his name but it was Japanese and he was also extremely friendly and helped us with all our London questions ! The hotel has a perfect location next to the Hard Rock Cafe ( ask for priority tickets at the concierge ) and Picadilly ! Shopping streets and the Abercrombie store are on 10 minutes walking of the hotel . Hyde Park Corner is the nearest Underground ! This time we paid with points but otherwise it is very expensive for what you get !
UR81646268	My wife and 2 year old daughter really enjoyed our stay at the IC London. There are not many hotel rooms that I can deem near faultless but this was certainly one. We were upgraded in terms of both room and also given club lounge access which really made a difference. I felt really recognised with the Ambassador membership scheme - something that doesn't often happen with Priority Club or even Ambassador at all Intercontinentals. The staff were exceptional for example arranging for a special childrens meal to be cooked and served for my daughter in the lounge on one night. Although this is undoubtedly a classy hotel we didn't feel out of place with a small child which was very welcoming and I think we'll definitely return!
UR80539622	Spent two nights at Intercontinental with 2 teenagers. Used my priority club bonus points to pay for the room, and happy I did that, as the price they charge for a room is way to high. Check-in was smooth and efficient.The room we got was just ordinary, nothing special. Actually quite small, and the bathroom was really small. Everything was very clean, however. Nice towels and bathroom products. There was a bathtub, which is always nice. Turndown service in the evening (No pillowmint, but the weatherforcast for the following day was left on the bedstand). We did not try out any of the restaurants, so cannot comment on that. Both Hyde park and Green park is next to the hotel, and it was really nice to go for a run in the park. Since our main goal when going to London always is shopping, I will not stay at this hotel another time, as there are plenty of other hotels to choose from closer to the main shopping areas, and with a much better value for your money. I have nothing negative to say about the Intercontinental, but there was nothing special about it either, it did not impress me in any way. The doormen were very friendly however, and since I was travelling with teenagers, it was a bonus to have Hard Rock Cafe just around the corner.
UR79166874	On our second trip to London, my husband and I spent 14 wonderful days at the Intercontinental Park Lane Hotel. All the staff we had dealings with during those 2 weeks were extrememly polite and most helpful in all areas. Because we were spending two weeks in one place it was important for us to have a room that would feel like home. Our room was a Classic..... it was spacious, an extremely comfortable king size bed with duvet and four large pillows. Housekeeping was definitely an A+. We received gifts of fruit, cookies, bottled water, etc...... several times during our stay. Each night when we returned to our room, our blankets were turned down, the lamps on and our slippers beside the bed........ and a note indicating the weather for the next day. We were extremely satisfied with the delicious Full English Breakfast that was included with our vacation package. The staff and cooks were most pleasant. This hotel is certainly well located between 2 parks and just a 15-minute walk from Buckingham Palace. The Hyde Park Corner Tube station and bus is a 5 minute walk ..... and a direct line to the Heathrow Airport via the Picadilly Line. Also a short walk from Harrod's, Oxford Street, and many other attractions. Janice & FranÃ§ois, Port-Daniel, QuÃ©bec (La GaspÃ©sie)
UR79053799	I got this hotel booking as a "5* top secret hotel" and it was described in lavish terms. The reality however, was more 4*, I'm afaid. The room was clean, but the bathroom was a little tired. On the plus side the breakfast menu was extensive, well presented and enjoyable as was our evening meal at the hotels restaurant, Theo Randalls.... I think if I had paid the full rate I would have felt short-changed, but I did get a good deal and because of that was able to be philisophical about my stay.
UR77623477	Prepaid three rooms for a four day stay to discuss business with clients. Arrived one day before our guests and things started as they were to continue. After about 20 mins fumbling with the computer, the receptionist turned to us and said 'I cannot find your reservation, sorry there is nothing I can do'. Not sure what she wanted us to do in response to this news (her attitude seemed to be that it was somehow our fault that the reservations were missing) we insisted she call her manager who sorted out the problem in two minutes (seems there is a glitch in the system which causes some bookings to be allocated to the wrong date). Not a good start but not the worst thing that could happen as we were later to find out. At last shown to our rooms the first thing to hit us on exiting the elevator was the overpowering stench of industrial strength chemicals. We later found out that the carpets had just had their annual cleaning and to mask the smell of the cleaners used, the hotel had installed some industrial-strength chemical air fresheners . End result was air quality somewhere between a badly ventilated dry cleaners and a chemical toilet. Being late we went straight to the rooms. After a couple of hours one of our party was in great distress and nearly in need of hospitalization. We took a poll and decided (at two in the morning) to abandon the booking and try to find another hotel. At this point, the Intercontinental offered us alternative accommodation on another floor which had been cleaned the week before and was less life-threatening. Eventually got to bed at around 3am, several hours after arriving at the hotel. Since they did not have enough rooms at the same grade to accommodate our room change, one of our party was forced to pay an upgrade fee to escape the chemical smell. Given the reason for the move, this seemed uncalled for but at 3am we were not in a mood to argue so paid up. Next morning's meetings did not go well. In addition to the 500 pounds per day room charge (normal for London if expensive), the hotel wanted to charge several hundred pounds extra for a projector (included in the room fee everywhere else). The sales reps' response to our complaint -- yes, you've guessed 'sorry, there is nothing I can do (this is our rate)' Well, at least we were now free to enjoy the hotel's facilities. This 'five star' hotel boasts exactly two cafes and restaurants or rather one of each. The restaurant was always empty and the cafe always full. There was a full 20 minutes queue for breakfast on Saturday. We would have had room service except that the rooms we occupied also had a residual chemical odor. The final straw came when one of our clients reported a theft from his room. With important documents being carried around on expensive computer equipment we felt we could no longer take the risk. We sacrificed the final two days of the prepaid reservation, kissing goodbye to several thousand irreclaimable dollars and decamped to a better venue.
UR76360888	I last stayed here 2 years ago when I wrote a review (It's still there to read if you are interested!) Two years on I still rate this as one of my top London hotels! It's the small touches that count in my opinion - evening turn down service is excellent with new towels if needed and slippers placed at the bedside (I particularly liked the way my 'stray' toiletries were neatly placed on clean linen cloths in the bathroom), spotlessly clean rooms and bathroom, Elemis toiletries, padded coathangers, 'proper' hairdryer, tea / coffee in the room (hotels that don't supply this really irritate me), iron and board ... my only gripe is that breakfast service could be a bit slicker - supplying tea / coffee, toast and clearing / relaying tables quickly really isn't that difficult a job is it? Haven't tried the Spa (looks a bit pricy) or the laundry service. Usually cheaper to book direct with the hotel as no upfront payment is needed then you check the online prices just before you check in and ring and ask them to match. Better still use your Priority Points but you may have to pay for breakfast!
UR76295090	Just returned from 2 night stay to celebrate my mum's 60th birthday. Hotel was lovely and the staff were wonderful. We were told we had been upgraded at check-in which was a lovely surprise, to find we had actually been given a double room despite booking a twin!! Were moved immediately to a twin, but don't feel the room was as good as the original one. Nice touch was a lovely birthday cake for my mum though. The choice and quality of breakfast was great, but one thing I was really unhappy and surprised at in a hotel of this quality was the plates by the hot buffet were just stacked on the table cold, so by the time you got your hot breakfast to your table, it had gone cold. Surely they can provide heated plates?? I have stayed in much cheaper hotels that have had hot plates to put your cooked breakfast on. On the second day, after a morning shopping we returned to the room at 1pm to get ready for afternoon tea at a nearby luxury hotel (will do separate review for that establishment!!) to find the room had not yet been serviced. Bit disappointed as we wanted to shower and had no clean/dry towels to use. This had been done by our return later in the day at 4.30pm though. Bar prices very expensive; Â£12.38 for two tiny cappuccinos was a bit of a shock, but I suppose this is to be expected in a 5* hotel in London. Couple of touches mentioned above did let it down slightly, but all in all we had a wonderful time and I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.
UR76138819	I had to write a review of this place because it was a real disappointment. The starter we had was described by a work colleague as "pigeon food." It was almost unbelievable. It consisted of prawns in a generic sauce with shredded iceberg lettuce, fom what I could surmise! The main course included an exquisite aubergine preserve with somewhat overcooked - if tender - lamb (and no pinkness). The vegetables were appalling, reminiscent in texture and flavour of a dollop of mashed turnip and carrot for school dinner. Overall, it tasted as though the chef had forgotten to season the main course. The dessert was so forgettable that I won't even mention it. Bearing in mind the price and the reputation, this merited a 'terrible' rating. On the other hand, this was a ball and therefore it may not be representative of the establishment's cooking as a whole. Nonetheless, it was really unacceptable.
UR76018279	Stayed at the IC over a weekend in early August with my wife and family and as Ambassador Members were upgraded. We negotiated a deal for an upgrade to the Club Lounge on arrival which was great value as it included a great breakfast with lots of fresh fruit (including raspberries, blueberries and strawberries) and unusually, a breakfast cooked to order!! Not served lukewarm from self servers as usual in most hotels. Enjoyed unlimited soft drinks, tea, coffee and nibbles all day, and a very happy "2 hour happy hour" with Moet and Chandon and all other beer, wine and spirits etc. Geat canapes and cheese, biscuits and other snacks. We found no need for a formal evening meal after our time in the lounge. Interesting to meet the Club Manager again, when we last met her, she was in the IC Sydney in March 2009. Great service again, thank you. Despite what might apear from above, we did go out, and the hotel is well located close to parks, west end and other tourist locations. Tip - travelled from St Pancras by tube and changed at Green Park onto line to Hyde Park. We walked so far underground at the interchange that it was quicker to get on/off at Green Park. Good quality hotel and I would use it again. Only negative comment, despite staying over a weekend (sat/sun) when we thought prices would be lower, quite expensive!!!
UR75051410	Booked this hotel through London Experience "Show & Stay" Â£647, this included 3 nights in the hotel (2 people) with full English breakfast, good seats for The Jersey Boys in the Prince Edward Theatre and a pre- theatre dinner in Marco Pierre White's restaurant L'Escargot - I believe that we got a a good deal. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, we didn't have any view from our room window (room 307) but the room itself was very comfortable, nice toiletries, good turn down service each evening with towels and toiletries replaced. Breakfast had a wonderful choice and was served until 10.30am which was great. Check out is noon which is also a plus. Walking distance to Fortnum & Masons, Picadilly, Buckingham Palace, Harrods. Taxis were always available outside hotel when required. The down sides were, we booked a twin room and arrived to find a double - they took quite a while, about an hour, to sort that out. There was also a mix up with our reflexology booking which had been made weeks in advance with the hotel spa. If I hadn't phoned to check beforehand I'm not sure we would have got what we wanted, however the sessions themselves were very good - Â£45 for half an hour and we were both given a full size shower gel in a nice gift bag as compensation for the mix up. The good far out weighed the not so good, we had a great stay and I would certainly choose this hotel again.
UR74683814	Pros: Beautiful hotel. Top of the line amenities. Top-notch service. Very comfortable rooms, with nice features (great lighting, nice TV, etc). Amazing club level lounge. One of the best locations in London. Cons: Location is great, but always busy and very touristy. Very expensive hotel. Internet should be included in high room rate, but it's not. If you're willing to spend a few extra dollars, the club level lounge is truly worth it. Beautiful views, free breakfast, nice other amenities.
UR72084175	This is a beautiful hotel with lovely rooms. But its location is what warrants the price tag. I would be perfectly happy staying somewhere else for half the price...but that's just me. The Mayfair is a beautiful hotel and hardly the same cost as the Inter-Continental (I think the Mayfair is also in a better location). I was extremely disappointed with the room service. I ordered room service twice and the food was cold both times. There is something disconcerting about eating cold food when you know it was hot...at some point.
UR71837165	As a Gold Ambassador member our experience at this hotel was a little disappointing. Having spent three weeks travelling the UK, London was our last stop before heading home. We booked the hotel over three months ago and at check in... which lasted nearly 20 minutes were put in a disabled room at the back of the hotel overlooking the hotel canopy and the adjacent building site, none of which was explained at check in. On discovering our room we contacted reception to express our dissatisfaction but were advised that the hotel was full... amazing that hotels are always full when your not happy... further discussion and a further 20 minutes and we were moved to another much smaller room with a slighlty better view... still not what you would anticipate from a five star hotel... whilst the staff were pleasant enough... they seemed way to busy... giving most of their time to the many business men checking in... a very disappointing start to our last few days in the UK
UR70796844	I was never treated with such kindness and respect! This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. Close to the original Hard Rock Cafe which my son loved! within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, make sure you catch the changing of the guards! Also close to one of the stops of the Red double decker busses. My son and I got separated one afternoon and the staff hurriedly made phone calls for me and had someone sit with me with water and drink until he finally came back to the hotel. Tip: always give your kids money for a cab back to the hotel. This hotel is definitely worth the price.
UR70599018	I am not sure what it is with Priority Club bookings but this is the second time that I was shown to a room in an ICG hotel that was not what was requested despite having called to double check the online booking. I booked a room with two queen beds for my wife and me and our teenage son but was given a superior room with a cot. The room I thought I had booked does not exoist in this hotel. The customer service desk provided an extra bed and this filled up the available floor space. However, our disappointment was tempered by a complimentary bottle of wine and a delicious ice-cream. Very comfortable bed. Room excellent and bed very comfortable. Staff attentive, friendly and polite. Excellent breakfast with delicious kippers! Will definately come again and will persist with the Priority Club booking system!
UR69965493	We had the opportunity to travel to Europe this June and stay in three different Intercontinental properties. My husband is a platinum level Priority Club member as well as Ambassador. We decided to pay for the nights at this hotel as it was the least expensive of the three. Upon arrival, our room was not ready (it was early) so we had a (very expensive) cup of coffee in the lounge before heading upstairs. The public spaces of the hotel are modern and upscale. The room was an upgrade as per the Ambassador program. It was a nice size and newly redecorated. The bath had a full tub and two sinks. There was a large flat screen TV, a large closet and mini-bar stocked with glasses, mugs and a teapot. The room was well-maintained during our stay and the sheets and towels were high quality. The bed was very comfortable and black-out curtains allowed us to sleep well. The room was quiet and the area was very nice. Two tube stations were nearby, the closest but less convenient was Hyde Park Corner. We found ourselves using Green Park, a slightly farther walk but more lines available. Shepherds Market was very close, with a number of restaurants and pubs. It was a very pretty walk from the hotel to Buckingham Palace. Hyde Park was just up the block. Overall a great location. Service in the hotel was pretty good but we did have an issue with the Concierge. At first we got a reservation for a French restaurant when we had requested something British. A new reservation was made and confirmed via note from their office, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had no record of it. Fortunately there were able to squeeze us in but it was somewhat embarrassing. In defense of the hotel, when brought this to the attention of the management, they were very apologetic and reduced some charges on our bill as compensation. Definitely not a deal-breaker. Because they knew we were traveling to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, they sent us cheesecake via room service one evening. Very Nice!
UR69772603	My second stay at IC Park Lane and yes- also this time the sleep in the fantastic beds with perfect pillows was just perfect. Obviously there is a problem being in London for a weekend holiday, and enjoying the sleep so much. As last time, an upgrading was provided - and this time the check in was much faster than last time - when i had to wait until 5 pm to get the room , buy hey .. the tasty bottle of white wine offered as an excuse made me forget the waiting.
UR69531304	The hotel was in a good location and was clean with comfortable beds. The lounge and resteraunts were great and the food excellent.. The concierge and reception staff were very efficient . The Spa was also great ! The decoration of the room is a little too classic but overall very good hotel
UR69128528	My experience could not have been more different to some of the more recent negative reviews. Upon arrival (circa noon) I was given a room immediately (I am an Ambassador Club member but not sure if that was the reason). The room (234) had a view of the park and was immaculate with furniture free of any scuff marks and the carpet in near pristine condition. The bathtub had a hand shower and a "rainfall" shower besides the standard faucet. The mattress was superb with no hint of sag from use and the room itself was relatively noise free despite high traffic in the hotel. The Cafe around the corner of the lobby had outstanding food although pricey - breakfast was 24 pounds for the full buffet. Unless one can tuck in vast quantities of food it is not worth it. The staff was very responsive (Freddy is simply the best!)
UR68718660	We stayed here to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary, and whilst we enjoyed our stay it was evident that the hotel has been cutting corners in every area. The room was nice, but relatively small.The furniture was showing signs of wear and tear. We had a card in our room adressed to someone else. The service in both the Lobby Bar and breakfast in the Cookbook Cafe was below par but the food in both was excellent. For example, we were one of only three occupied tables in the bar yet had to wait 10 minutes for someone to take our order (despite two waiters working in the area clearing tables and serving one of the other tables). At breakfast we were ignored once seated, no offer of more coffee, toast etc. The hotel is very expensive which would be fine if the service matched the price; sadly this was not our experience. I would stay here again if the price was in the region of Â£250-300 per night, not Â£400-500 (for a deluxe room).
UR68138875	As a platingum ambassador member of the priorty rewards programme I usually stay at Intercontinental Hotels and usually the hotel is of a high standard. Unfortunatley this hotel did not meet the standard of a 5 star hotel. On the positive side the hotel was in a good location and was clean with comfortable beds. The louge and resteraunts were great and the food excellent.. The concierge was very efficient and booked tickets for a show for me with very short notice. The Spa was also great and although the therapist I had to was great the same could not be said for the receptioist who spent most of her time making private calls. The hotel was let down by tardy service and saftey issues. I arrived at 4:30 pm and my room was not ready - this took another half hour. Check in time is 2pm so I was concerned that the room was not ready. when I was finally given the key I walked into the room and found a man standing in there. he explained that he was hotel engineering but he could not explain what he was actually fixing or checking. I reported this to the reception who advised that he was changing a battery in the remote control for the TV. Two days running my room was not serviced and I had to call housekeeping to come in and service the room. One morning I spent in the room and discovered that the amount of "staff" accessing the room was disturbing. At least three people attended asking to check things such as mini bar, the maids work in servicing the room ( interesting as previously reported the room failed to be serviced twice) plus another person supervising the wrk of the mini bar stocker. I spoke to a member of staff who confided to me that some of the staff were taken from agencies and were not subject to security checks. although a nice hotel in decor etc the security issues gave me concerns so I am unlikley to stay here again. The hotel resteraunts are expensive but if you are on a budget there are plenty of great resteraunts close by for example Shepherds market has a number of great eating places. Also Marks and Spencer food hall is close by so you can buy ready made salads and sandwiches.
UR67813792	This trip was a suprise for my daughters 40th birthday and my husbands 60th birthday. we were upgraded to a superior room which was quite large and very very nice. All the staff from check in to staff at breakfast were very polite and just wanted to help you all the time. Another nice touch by the hotel was a chocolate birthday cake for both my husband and my daughter. I would most definately stay there again as it was a wonderfull experience.
UR67562468	I stayed at the Interconti Park Lane this June 2010. At breakfast I was given a seat in the upstairs section, when I went to go back to my seat after getting food at the buffet the seat was taken, so I sit downstairs to which the waiter asks me why and what was wrong with the upstairs, anyway then he starts to clear the cutlery away at the empty seat at my table for 2, to which I say my friend will be joining me, he replies I will return it when he comes. So I go get some food and I move to the adjacent table which has 2 sets of cutlery, the same waiter then sticks his thumb in my bowl of cereal AS I'm EATING! And pulls the bowl away. Needless to say I was angry and say your rude, to which he replies *no I'm not*.
UR67496202	This hotel is conveniently located opposite Hyde Park and just a 10min walk to Oxford Street. We found our twin room on the 7th floor very clean, comfortable and most importantly quiet. The room provided the usual facilities expected with a 5* property, including Elemis products in the bathroom. Although we only stayed for 1 night, our room was still cleaned again after arrival, towels re-folded and bins emptied etc. The staff throughout were exceptionally courteous, polite and extremely helpful. Each member of staff we came across, all greeted us politely. The downfall came with a chaotic breakfast, which was a real shame. The breakfast room appears to be too small for the number of guests. We stood waiting for a table for 15mins. During this time, many members of staff approached us and apologised for our long wait, we were offered a glass of juice while we were waiting, and I felt that these staff members were embarrased by the situation. We eventually were seated and I ordered tea and toast, then went to join the queue for eggs. There was 1 man cooking eggs and omlettes etc, and there were 12 people ahead of me in the queue! This poor man was juggling guests that had ordered and were waiting at their tables, orders stood in front of him and the pressure of a mounting queue. By the time I finally got my eggs, my toast was cold and my tea stewed. To add insult, a very loud American tour guide proceeded to list the days events to his tour party, drowning out any conversations of anyone else in the breakfast room who just wanted to enjoy a quiet, relaxing breakfast. This was far too chaotic and disorganised for me. The hotel need to address the staff numbers at breakfast time, especially at the counter serving cooked food. I work in Travel Retail and I would recommend this hotel for its location, room comforts and friendly staff, but not for a quiet, relaxing breakfast.
UR66915969	Stand out service - the best I have experienced at a London Hotel. Nosebleedingly expensive food and drink though, particularly if it's not going to be claimed on business expenses (eg can of coke from minibar Â£5)
UR66207365	overall had a great experience with the hotel. arrived early and didn't have to wait for a room and also got a late check out. Everyone we dealt with on the hotel staff was extremely friendly and handled all our requests with a smile. Perfect location to walk to Green Park or Hyde Park. Room was spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable. Also a good selection on stations on the television. If i had one negative thing to say it would be that you still need to pay for internet access. I hope one day there will be free wi fi in all hotels.
UR65984398	it was a holiday weekend in london so prices were high. however service was good only if you asked for it. i didnt get a toothbrush & shaver until i asked for it - though they arrived in 5 min. ...newspapers didnt arrive but i wasnt too bothered about that
UR65941298	Stayed one night on Priority Club points with my son. The staff were very friendly and allowed us to check in at 8am after a transatlantic flight. Twin room was small but very comfortable. The hotel is modern, elegant, and in a great location, but lacks historical ambience. I paid with points, but actual $$ room rates seemed a bit high.
UR64463828	The location of this hotel is excellent. Next to a subway station, direct connection to Heathrow airport. Opposite of Hyde park, within reasonable walking distance to Oxford street, Bond Street etc. and close to Buckingham palace. When we checked in our room was clean, but we did not get the keys because a second check had to be done. We stalled our luggage at the reception and they brought it to our room. This was very efficient and helpful. Although we are platinum members of the Intercontinental hotels, we did not get an upgrade to the next level of rooms. We reserved two rooms under our platinum card, and we only got one free upgrade (we had to ask for it). This is not the way you threat your most loyal guests. The room was nice. We had a view to the park, but we also could look into other rooms, this resulted in the fact that we closed the curtains the entire time. You do not want to look in other rooms. Also people who were sitting on the balcony of the hotel next to us could watch into our room. We totally did not like this. The room was small but had everything we needed. They have a B&O television, a Bose sound system etc. You have to shower in the bath, this is something I really hate. The bathroom was tiny, we could not be there together at the same time. What I did not like was that there is no sauna or pool next to the gym. The gym is without instructors. The hotel makes a lot of advertisement for the spa, but there is no normal sauna where you can make use of. After the gym I want to be able to take a shower or to go to the sauna, but this was not possible, unless you shower in your room. Breakfast was good. I did not like the placemats with the prices of the breakfast. This looked very cheap. We had to pay extra for the breakfast. During check out we did not get our breakfast bill, this is directly charged from your credit card, without signing for it, this is not acceptable. We wanted to make use of the business centre. They do know how to charge for everything. You pay for the use of the Internet and also for printing. We stayed in a lot of hotels where printing was a service, but here you have to pay for everything. The Internet in the room is not wireless and costs GBP 15 per 24 hours. There is no free wifi in the bars / hall as most 5-star hotels do have these days. Also as platinum guest you do not get any other benefits. No water in the room, no flowers, no chocolates during turn down service. Nothing. In my opinion 5-star hotels need to provide a bottle of complimentary water for the night, as the price for a night is high in the hotels. But Intercontinental Park Lane does not give you any water. We probably come back, especially for the location. The hall is beautiful, the rooms are cozy, not my taste and are not in the same style as the hall. Checkout was efficient. We asked 3 times if it was possible to get a late check out. This was finally possible for one of the two rooms. However late check out was 4 PM (the same time as late check out for Platinum guests of Intercontinental is), so actually no late check out for us.
UR64350777	I stayed in the Intercontinental Park Lane with my mother and two kids. I enjoyed our stay very much. The bedding was cozy and comfortable. The room was well appointed. The location is great for both business travelers and tourists. The staff was helpful and even gave the kids both a welcoming gift and a good-bye gift. What I like best about this hotel is that it is a 5 star hotel but at the same time rather casual. For a person like me who enjoys 5 star hotels, but likes too seek out ones that make children feel welcome, this is ideal. We ate at Theo Randall's one evening and it was superb, just delicious! Since we were with my young girls, we ate dinner rather early and we offered the pre-theatre menu which was a fantastic value. We had breakfast every morning at The Cookbook Cafe and loved it. The food and the staff were just brilliant. The kids loved it too. We did dine there once and it was ok, but breakfast was much better.
UR62994506	The overall "feel" of the hotel is quite expensive, with chandeliers in the Reception area and staff opening the doors for you 24x 7, very polite and helpful. We were upgraded to a better room as we are Ambassador Club members but we got very little extra for our membership - a bottle of water and three pieces of fruit in fact. Access to the Club facilities was an additional 60 British pounds per night, but is probably good value for what that includes, breakfast, happy hour etc. Rooms were tastefully appointed and reasonably spacious, with good lighting, flat screen TV, coffee and tea making facilities included. All staff we encountered were very good and extremely helpful, maps, umbrellas and recommendations were freely offered. The hotel is located in the premier area in Park Lane near Kensington Gardens alongside Green Park, so its expensive to begin with. However don't expect that you will get high speed internet included in the room price - its not. Its not free even in the foyer and bar area (as per most 5 star hotels now.) Mobile/cell phone coverage in the hotel Reception area is really poor, non-existent for some networks, but better on higher floors.
UR62135865	I don't normally get so effusive, but having just returned from a stay here, I've nothing but praise for the whole place and all the staff who make it work so well. Everything was just about the epitome of perfection: the superb location; our room; the warmly welcoming and attentive staff; the flawless and most enjoyable fine dining at Theo Randall's - so much so, that it would be a bit pointless to try to single out any aspect. Our stay was largely funded by Premier Points, so we were largely insulated from the high price tag involved - but, believe me, it's still good value for anyone's money !
UR60853540	We were lucky enough to win a weekend break in London at the Intercontinental Park Lane. The hotel is lovely and the rooms are luxurioius. We travelled with our little 2 year old daughter and even had little bed slippers for her in our room - little things that mean so much. The room was very well equipped and we were very impressed. We did not get enough time to visit the other amenities of the hotel since it was a short visit. It was a great stay, we highly recommend this hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly and we even had the possibility for a late check out (complementary).
UR59908173	My experience was very similar to other reveiwers. The staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful. The concierge could be counted on for spare camera batteries, recommendations of places to eat and good local knowledge. The superior room was a good size with well appointed facilities. Although the direct web site stated DVD players in rooms and ours did not have one. Everywhere was spotlessly clean, well decorated and to a high level but never over done. The location is very central with an upmarket bias. As with most London locations you can walk or jump on a tube to get anywhere else. Only small gripe is like all 5* hotels they do pride themselves on service - when it comes to bar service though they seem to overdo this. Twice we were turned away from the bar to be sent table service but then waited over 10 mins each time to 1) place an order 2) receive our drinks and then 3) settle up. However if you can swerve the table service or have better patience than us, the bar is quiet and very comfortable with great snacks. We did not eat here during our stay as all our weekend budget went on the room (!) but have eaten here before and the food was good (if 5* hotel priced). However there are many budget places to eat nearby (including a good selection of pubs). Of course this is not a cheap place to stay but then it is not selling itself as such; I do think it is good value for the quality and staff and a fantastic place for a treat.
UR59562039	We had a vey enjoyable few days at the Intercontinental. The location was excellent, with lots of places in walking distance and several tube stations nearby. The room was comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. What made it stand out for us though was excellent and down to earth assistance from all the staff we came in contact with --from the reception places sorting out some booking glitches (not their fault so far as I could tell), the Concierge desk with suggestions and friendly assistance to all the other staff. It was pricey, we thought, although I think you could pay more in London for less. Particularly when we needed an extra room at the last minute. But if the expense works out for your budget, particularly if there are any deals going, we thought it a fun and comfortable stay.
UR59485385	My first visit to this hotel had been a great however, the last was certainly a big let down. We arrived to check in at the appointed time and were told the room was not ready and would we like a complementary drink which was a good gesture however after 40 mins we decided that our 2 night break was being wasted by sitting in the hotel lounge. so we ventured out - we were phoned to say the room was ready about 20 mins later. When we finally returned to the hotel and the room we were somewhat weary and just wanted to relax and get ready for the evening, I was dismayed to walk six or seven paces and trip on frayed carpet, the room was clean and tidy but bore no resemblence to our previous stay, we asked for water to be brought to our room and it arrived 45 mins later, we pointed out the carpet and were told to discuss it with reception. We could be moved to a smoking room or pay an upgrade to the next level, we choose to stay in the room but stressed the danger with the carpet. I fully expected to return to the room and find tape or something over the carpet, but this never happened. or reception to have come up with us to look at the complaint. After check out I fully expected my survey and compaint to warrant contact from the hotel - this has never happened. While this episode did cause a slight bad taste, we enjoyed our trip to London and the Hotel is certainly in a good spot and the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park was a lovely festive place to visit. The food at Theo Randalls and the Cook Book cafes breakfast are supberb, but the customer satisfaction when dealing with a complaint is give them a bottle of wine and that will shut them up.
UR59480055	Just returned from a 3 night business trip attending a conference in London. This hotel has to be one of the best I have stayed in London. We had a superior room on the 3rd floor which was very tastefully decorated (olde worlde style but with all the mod-cons like Bose stereo, B&O TV). The hotel is absolutely spotless. The outstanding things about this hotel is 1. Their attention to detail. Little "touches" like the evening turndown service, tidying your bits and bobs in the bathroom which you left in mess in the rush to get you. It all makes the difference. 2. The staff here have to be the friendliest and helpful in any hotel i have stayed in. They look like they really enjoy working at this hotel. If they don't then they are putting on a good show. Only one little tiny niggle was with the key-cards not working in the door. But, give the receptionist his due, he said my mobile phone can "wipe" the card so keep them separate. I did and it continued to work. Normally, I try to steer clear of large "chain" hotels like this, but could not really avoid on this occassion as staying in London. But may have to re-think this informal rule of mine now! Of course, all this comes at a price, but have to say, its well, well worth the extra money. Well done Intercontinental!
UR58395635	Fantastic value place to stay using Priority Points - go for upgraded room that doesn't cost any more points! Celebrated a special birthday - got complimentary birthday cake, fruit & birthday card - really nice personal touch for a 5* hotel. Full marks to Guest Relations.Great location, well appointed room & really comfortable bed - will have to save points for another stay!
UR57975989	I chose the Intercontinental to surprise my girlfriend and pop the question... The hotel customer service was aware of my plans and they made our stay something both of us will not forget!!! We got upgraded to a suite and they surprised us with complementary champagne and cake. I asked the customer service to also provide chocolate and flowers, I trusted them on that and I was completely right! All was just PERFECT!!! When I checked in, all the staff at reception kept on talking about the bunch of roses they got for my girlfriend and I understood why when I opened the door of the room! It was perfect and they obviously won two customers. We will definitely go back, maybe for our wedding anniversaries :-)))
UR57942224	This hotel is OK but not great for the price you pay Check In is very tedious was told that the rooms are ready but they have to be checked had to wait another 20-25 mins waiting for the rooms Rooms are nice and large altho the view of another wall is very boring, the dark wood and colours of the room also feel a bit dated and could do with some work, although the TV's had a great selection of stations, but the alarm clock is the other side of the room Housekeeping really need to be able to speak the language, was offered turn down, asked them to come back after we left and was given an odd look and no turndown Concierge are very good and helpful booked everything we needed and gave us all the details needed so could do better as there is many more better and cheaper hotels in the area
UR57818590	This was my second stay at this fine hotel and was just as good as my first, 18 months ago. You can't beat the Park Lane location and I found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly. The concierge got me a good seat (on short notice) to the soccer game I wanted to attend and he made an excellent pub recommendation (Audley in Mayfair) when I told him I wanted a good shepherd's pie. The rooms are elegant and spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed and linens and the bathrooms are well-appointed. The shower has great water pressure - often a surprise in Europe. I also enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the open, sunny dining room, which has a nice, contemporary feel. Room service was quick and the food was good. I was very comfortable and felt taken care of there, and won't hesitate to return!
UR57440776	Stayed with my wife over the weekend - comfortable and enjoyable stay in a superior room. Reasonably positioned hotel with a 20 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus. Room was spotlessly clean and large - all staff friendly and attentive. The bathroom was small but adequate and had Elemis extras for washing/shampooing etc. We did not eat any food in the hotel. Breakfast was a ridiculous price so we found several places within a 5 minute walk ( in Shepherd Market ) who did cooked breakfast for 2 people for about Â£10 - Â£20. Other than breakfast eating, I recommend this hotel.
UR57087990	Located between Hyde and St. Jamesâ€™ Parks, this hotel is the place to be in London if youâ€™re up to non-stop sightseeing. A very elegant lobby, restaurant and bar. A room that is classic but yet contemporary (mine had a small balcony with fantastic views of the city). The room was very well maintained and housekeeping was flawless â€“ also putting together a great turndown service. The staff were fantastic. I cannot stress this enough. It is very hard to find a hotel where everyone - from housekeeper, porter to general manager â€“ wishes you a good day as they walk past you. A golden star goes to reception, especially Chloe, who was fantastic. The business center was very well appointed and manned. I walked through the fitness center and it was clean and had state of the art equipment. I wish I had stayed here for a little longer, to be able to fully enjoy their hospitality, but I will surely stay nowhere else when returning to London.
UR57018529	Allocated 'superior' smoking bedroom, which was a good size with comfortable bed and fittings, but the bathroom was far too small for a five star hotel, and the parking, @ Â£50 per 24 hours, is outragous, especially as it is also charged for disabled drivers who do not bring their car through choice, but by necessity. Great staff, alaws willing to help whatever the request.
UR56866439	Other reviews and photo's say it all. We had a superior room with a view over a roof top bar and over to the park. Booked using Priority Club points. All staff very attentive and polite, but not overly friendly. No real personality to the hotel, probably what you get from this class of hotel. Room well cleaned and maintained. We did not eat in the hotel. The location is excellent, easy walk along Piccadilly in to the West End, or along Hyde Park to the museum area. Also close to Buck house if that is your interest. We found a couple of nice little pubs in the back streets behind the hotel, recommend you explore this area (including Guy Ritchie's Punch Bowl Pub, nice but pricey!). I wouldn't pay full price for this hotel, but as a freebie it is excellent value!!
UR56572948	I am always happy to stay at the Park Lane Intercontinental. The staff is always very polite. The rooms are perfect and the location is perfect. Walking distance from Harrods, Oxford Street and right at the start of the Picadily street. The Club Lounge is also one of my favorites, with very friendly staff, very clean and with a perfect view of the city. This is the best Intercontinental hotel I have visited and I always look forward to staying there. This was my 3rd visit and it has been always a pleasure.
UR56169072	Wonderful hotel with excellent, friendly staff. Luckily we managed to get a smoking room which we were told was apparently a little smaller than others but we didnâ€™t mind as it was nice to get a choice. The room was very comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was lovely and very clean, if a little on the small side. The bed was wonderfully comfortable, with soft high quality linen and we both had a great nights sleep. Breakfast I believe is from 6.30am to 10.30am. We went down about 10.20am and though the place was still relatively busy, we didnâ€™t have to wait for a table. The only downsides were the very expensive mini bar (Â£7 for a bottle of Budweiser) and that we were unable to get a later check out. Overall highly recommended and fabulous service. We did have one major issue, not with the hotel but with Intercontinental's central reservations team. As we booked through a third party agent, we had to contact central reservations after the booking was made in the event of any query. I unfortunately had the misfortune to speak to an agent called Georgia who was rude and off hand.
UR55845634	to start - the pluses - unbeatable location, compact full service hotel, courteous staff the minuses - smallish room with strong smell of cigarette smoke even on a non-smoking floor (suspect it is backdrafting through bathroom extraction vents from other floors)
UR55447222	We have just returned from a weekend stay at the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane. We booked the hotel on the hotel's web site and got a good internet rate (this was after extensive trawling through the discount hotel sites as well....). The location of the hotel is perfect. It is between Hyde Park and Green Park in a lovely leafy area. Everything is walkable from the hotel and the Hyde Park tube station is literally accross the road with Green Park tube just 5 minutes up the road. Our room looked a little small on first impressions but that may be just because the bed was huge...we actually found that we had plenty of space. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great. We had a room that looked out on to an internal courtyard which was fine as we could open the windows and not worry about traffic noise although a park view roooms would have been nice. The hotel is nicely busy with plenty of people milling about all day and the hotel bar is a nice venue in which to have a nightcap. We had breakfast in the hotel on day and it was excellent - it is cheaper if you book it the night before so I would recommend doing that. All in all an excellent hotel and one that I will definitely return to again.
UR55013779	I am not usually one for writing reviews and this is my first. Sadly it is a negative one, as I felt compelled to share my experience. I am (or was) a loyal Intercontinental traveler and am an Ambassador member. I travel to London on a regular basis and almost always stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane. I have had mixed experiences in the past and have noticed throughout my stays a steady decline in service levels (particularly from the check in staff). However this trip was a total farce from beginning to end. The check in was muddled and confused and the check in staff were rude, disinterested and seemingly incompetent (they had to check several details that they should have known and different staff gave different information). We were upgraded to an Executive room, but then told we could not enter the lounge (which seemed utterly pointless, as the Executive rooms are exactly the same as the Deluxe rooms that we booked, but with lounge access, so what was the point of the upgrade?), they placed my parents in a disabled room and when they asked to be changed were given a room that didnâ€™t fit the description they had been given (they had had enough of complaining by then and just accepted it!). The final straw came was when we checked out they overcharged our stay and I spent 3 weeks of phone calls and emails to try and rectify the problem (the person who we needed to speak to was never available, apparently). Eventually they agreed to refund via email, without a single apology or recognition of their error and then went on to say my father (a platinum Ambassador member) had been undercharged (which he hadnâ€™t) and tried to charge him more money! I shanâ€™t be staying there again, nor will I be renewing my Ambassador status. It is such a shame, it is fantastic hotel in a great location, and all their problems could easily be solved by some decent staff training. Something they seem disinterested in doing and seem to have no interest in customer service or customer retention.
UR54939290	The hotel is near the palace but there arent any restaurants around it. The hotel more than makes up for it. It is near the tube station, excellent staff that are very helpful, a great lounge you can get into on the 7th floor which serves breakfast and in the afternoons they have cocktails, you can also ask for an internet card and you dont have to pay for internet at the front desk. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Definately would stay at this hotel even though it is not that close to attractions.
UR54618456	The other reviewers are being somewhat mealy mouthed about this hotel which certainly deserves its five star rating. It does overlook Park Lane and unless you choose one of the cheaper rooms the views over the park are all good. If you get club access then the free breakfast afternoon tea and evening drinks make this 5 star very good value. Another reviewer claimed it was a Holiday Inn. I wonder what Holiday Inns he has stayed in because if they are like this I want to go. No it is not as luxurious as the Dorchester or Claridges but they all charge considerably more. The problem is that the more expensive hotels get the more discerning visitors (picky!) otherwise how else can one explain how some of the great London hotels are so far down the list. This hotel deserves a higher rating than 98. Try it and enjoy good value
UR54277942	My friend and I stayed at the Intercontinental in London over the summer, so this review is a bit late, but I doubt much has changed in the past few months. The hotel was in a decent location and it was clean and safe, the bathrooms had a very nice rain shower, and the doormen were really nice . . . but those are the only nice things I have to say about it. The problems started with the booking process. My friend and I booked a two-bed room through American Airlines, and in addition I called the hotel directly two weeks before we were to arrive to confirm that a room with two beds would be available for late check-in. Que arrival: There's an immediate scramble to find us a room. We were told that the request for two rooms wasn't on our reservation and there was only one room left with two beds . . . on the first floor, right next to the gym (highly noisy). I knew that instead of the deluxe room we booked this was going to be Cinderella's room because logic dictates hotels give out their nicer rooms first, but it was 1am at this point and there was nothing to be done so we just went to the room. I felt like I was entering a Holiday Inn. In fact, if memory serves me, some Holiday Inns are nicer than our hotel room was. Picture: two single beds on wheels, four t.v. channels, a broken lamp, old scuffed furniture, and a non-functioning alarm clock. To make a long story short, when we asked nicely if there were any other rooms available since we had paid for a deluxe room and had booked early, we were rejected. It also became apparent that we weren't getting any amenities (unless you count getting your pajamas folded 3 times a day an amenity). The expressionless Germanic desk staff did not budge on anything. Only when they gave me a comment card an hour before check-out and I went to the front desk to ask for a notepad write on (yep, didn't have those, either. Holiday Inns always have notepads) did a manager miraculously appear - apparently the poor kid behind the desk sensed the type of comment I was about to leave. For our troubles, the manager questioned why we didn't say anything before (hello, we tried multiple times!) and then graciously offered to let us check out an hour late. As you might imagine, we said thanks, but no thanks. Bottom line: this particular Intercontinental is not worthy of a 5 star rating. Maybe there were some nice rooms available, but we sure as heck weren't in one and the experience was mediocre at best for the price. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a hardship to stay at the hotel and if it had actually been a Holiday Inn I would not utter a single complaint, but for the amount of money we were paying (Almost $500 a night) it was not acceptable. For the same price I could have been at the Marriott or Four Seasons and had a worthy 5 star experience and probably a bed that didn't roll. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone but a business traveler with low expectations and a company that doesn't mind a load of in-room charges to the corporate AMEX.
UR53461771	The hotel is in a wonderful location across from Hyde Park and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Harrods, West End theater - although there is a tube stop at the corner if you don't care for a long walk. I'm an interior designer so the first thing I notice about hotels is the ambiance and quality of furnishings. My guess is that this hotel has been recently refurbished from top to bottom. It sparkled with newness. The rooms are lovely with nice bathrooms (not large but well designed). The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there over New Years and when we came in from the cold (after watching the fireworks from the Eye) they had hot chocolate and hot tomato soup in the lobby and an unannounced dance party going on in the lounge. Another nice touch is that they have quality umbrellas at the front door for guest to use. My little fold up one was not built for London weather so I was please with that touch. Everything was high quality from the umbrellas to the linens to the TV's (Bang & Olufsen) to the defogging bathroom mirror. My only negative would be to say that there isn't anything distinctly "British" about the design of the hotel - it is a lovely contemporary hotel that could be anywhere in the world.
UR52739297	I am usually an advocate of the InterContinental brand, therefore was expecting great things from the flagship. However, I was a touch disappointed by the lack of care and attention displayed by some of the staff during my stay. On arrival, i was greeted by a very friendly doorman, but had to carry my bag to the front desk, where I then had to queue to check in. Sense of arrival was not there and for a five star property I expected more. On the way to the rooms, the corridor was littered with room service trays with food debris and when entering my room, I was shocked at the size of the bathrooms. Very small. I ordered room service and it took an hour to arrive. Once finished I called for the tray to be removed and it was not until a few hours later. However, the food was delightful and a great choice was available, both on the menu and the Italian restaurant. My friend was equally impressed. The hotel has all the facilities, location and creative flair to be an exceptional hotel. What lets it down is the attention to detail. This I know I can get from other five star hotels in London.
UR52371732	Stayed here for 4 nights just before Christmas. Historically we've been Hilton fanatics but we have now changed brands after this stay and one earlier in the year at Cannes. The room was excellent, the executive lounge was complete perfection, they served Moet champagne for free which always helps and the canapes were devine. Great service, central location, fantastic atmosphere what more do you need.
UR52217706	Stayed one night here en route to Heathrow airport with my wife and two young daughters - used priority club freebies to book two connecting rooms, which are normally rather expensive. I am an intercontinental platinum ambassador and was upgraded to deluxe rooms and was offered club access - initially they asked for a fee of Â£60 but eventually this was waived. The rooms are luxurious and the hotel itself is very classy. The club lounge is outstanding - even compared to other intercontinentals such as Sydney that has spectacular views. The view from up there is superb and the service is excellent. In the morning they offered a cooked breakfast in addition to an excellent selection of fruit, croissants and other items. The icing on the cake was the helpful attitude of the staff throughout the hotel - we could see that they made an effort to anticipate our needs from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Nothing was a problem for them. We had little time to have breakfast and catch our car to the airport at 7am and all staff from the club lounge to the amazing porters and front desk did their bit to ensure we left on time for the airport, acting in a coordinated way - a very refreshing experience from most modern hotels where the left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing. Our only regret is that we did not have more time to enjoy the hotel and the excellent location.
UR51739949	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights totally when we visited London. It was really a good hotel with clean room, friendly staff and great breakfast. Moreover, the location was very good and helped us alot to visit whole parts of Lon Don on foot. Highly recommend!
UR51622949	The hotel has an excellent location and a wonderful view of London, if you manage to get a room on one of the top floors. The room we got was quite spacious and beautifully decorated. Staff is always friendly and the hotel tends to always be busy. Sitting in the lobby bar for a drink or snack is highly recommended. The flower decorations in the lobby are breathtaking.
UR51181691	The location, rooms, fitness centre, breakfast buffet and Cookbook Cafe dinner made this hotel exceptional. None of its near neighbours come close!
UR51161162	Nice hotel..good quality breakfast with plenty of choice. Rooms clean and comfortable. Location good for Knightsbridge, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace but a bit far out for the West End unless you take a taxi. Our room was very noisy as we were right next door to the store cupboard and the doors were opening and closing all night. We had to speak to management three times to be moved which isn't very professional and not what you'd expect of a 5 star hotel. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.
UR49968664	I've been an IC Ambassador for many years including the top tier Royal Ambassador. Prior to the upgrade / modernisation the hotel was classic in appearance but not such that refurbishment would have been required immediately, indeed by doing so much of the charm of the hotel has been lost into the builders skip and in all honesty I really can't see major improvements other than room upgrades and some aesthetic changes in the lobby area. What strikes you is the change in management style, it is obvious new management have been brought into the hotel to match the new modern appearance whom are nothing more than impolite and arrogant. To be clear with you all, I am writing this review after my third stay at the hotel since refurbishment and have stayed there quite a few times prior to the closure a few years ago... There are no welcoming smiles and no invites to the club lounge, you get exactly what you are entitled to a one level upgrade and there is no discretion at the reception which you could stomach if the rooms and hotel itself were very special, but they just are not... particularly at the rates they charge which are nothing short of an attitude being, "...well we know these rich cats will pay so lets cream the sods..." and I for one have started staying elsewhere in London. As a comparisson I stayed in Intercontinetal Miami for three days after this stay and it was night and day, so the problem isn't the IC group it's just this hotel whom in their own minds seem to think they are a little bit special. My suggestion, save your money and stay closer to the town in comaprable hotels of quality and style which are numerous. The IC London has been outclassed before it was ever even finished with the refurbishment... a truly sad waste of a hotel.
UR49838869	We stayed at the hotel to go to the Patriots@Buccaneers game. I have been to London many times and it's always the same thing: very expensive hotels and small rooms. But this time it was different. We stayed 4 nights: 3 nights on a friends&familiy rate (135 pounds) and one night through Priceline (130 pounds!!). The room we got was big, certainly for London standards, and very comfortable. We had a corner room looking out over Hyde Park. Even tough that means a lot of traffic, we didn't hear anything. Beds are great, bathroom is wonderful (loved the shower), and the room was just great! Breakfast was good (buy it in advance, saves you 50%. Which helps because otherwise it is ridiculously expensive). We didn't have dinner at the hotel (BTW, the Hard Rock Cafe is around the corner, if you're into that). The bar is small but ok. The lobby itself is small, but then again, it gives a 'cosy' atmosphere to the hotel. Location of the hotel is excellent. You're right next to Hyde Park. Exford street is 10 minutes away, Mayfair is next door, Buckingham Palace is 10 minutes away, as is Harrods. And the subway station nearby as well. So, location-wise you're ok here. A special thanks to the concierge: he got us reservations at Fifteen, even tough it was full. But even better: we found out that Monty Python was going to play at the Royal Albert Hall during our stay. I'm a big Python fan, so I wanted to go there, but of course it was sold out. I asked the concierge if he could do some magic and guess what: he got us tickets at face value. And they were excellent seats!!! Perfect!! All in all a very pleasant stay!
UR49556993	I stayed at the Intercontinental recently and have to comment on what a lovely stay and warm welcome I received from the staff. Having had a long day on the road I arrived very tired and flustered where I was greeted at reception by Dominic who obviously on seeing how stressed I was made me feel very welcome and kindly upgraded me to a suite. The room itself was lovely very luxurious and quiet with quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. There were good quality Elemis toiletries in the bathroom and everything I could have asked for. We ate in the Italian restaurant in the evening and the food was delicious, the service was very quick without being rushed and for a London hotel I thought it was very reasonably priced. The one thing I do have to comment on in particular is the staffs willingness to help. When I arrived back home I realised that I had left my glasses at the hotel and after experiences at other hotels assumed I would never see them again. I couldn't have been more wrong the staff went and found them for me and had them posted back within days at no cost to myself. This is a 5* hotel worthy of the accolade, I would not hesitate to return and strongly recommend you give it a try.
UR49442945	We were happy with the location (close to great shopping, eating, and sites of interest), the staff were helpful and the amenities at this hotel were good, particularly the Cookbook restaurant. The room was also well-equipped and tasteful.
UR49343377	I have just come back from a weekend in London staying at the Intercontinental Hotel on Park Lane and just wanted to say what an abolutely fantastic hotel this is. I am used to staying in 5 star hotels and realise that expectations are high however I have to say the Interconti exceeded them.... the reason... the staff and the service! So many times the big hotels are faceless however this couldnt have been more different. Nothing was too much trouble and never have I found everyone to be so friendlt it was teh same whetehr is was reception, the doorman, concierge, the restaurant or housekeeping. They actually seemed to take pleasure and pride in their jobs which is rare these days. It isnt cheap but then you get what you pay for - or in the case of this hotel you actually get what you only hope to receive. We didnt eat in teh main restaurant but I did sample breakfast in both the cookbook cafe and the lobby lounge and both were outstanding. I cant recommend this hotel high enough.
UR48776843	We had a very good stay at the Intercontinental Park Lane. We arrived very early and our non smoking room wasn't ready, but we were given a card to access the club lounge and as we decided to go out for a walk we left luggage at the reception and we were asked for our mobile phone number to call when the room was ready. We had just sat down in Green Park when we had a call to say the room was ready, keys just needed to be collected and luggage was already waiting in the room. The superior room we booked was very large with a nice view, bose sound system and B&O TV. As the club lounge was something we added on I wanted to be sure vegeterians would be catered for, so I contacted the lounge in advance. The staff were very helpful and not only arranged vegeterain options for us, they called to confirm a time when we would like the canopes to ensure it was fresh and when we arrived we were waited on with the vegeterian options bought over to our table along with as many alcholic drinks that we wanted. The following morning's breakfast in the lounge was very nice, lots of buffet options and also hot food. We opted for the waffles and they were very nice, but word of warning the waffles are huge, we made the mistake of having some buffet food before the waffles arrived. All of the staff we encounted were very pleasent and couldn't do enough for us. I would definately recommend this hotel to others.
UR48764806	Got a good price on a room for two nights in November. Booked with last minute dot com. Great location, service was good, breakfast both mornings was excellent. On criticism of the hotel was that room was a little on the small side... had a room facing an inner courtyard, possibly one of the cheaper rooms called " classic room". Rooms facing Park Lane looked bigger. Twin room, but with only two small single beds... not the usual 2 x double which you get in places like marriott... however got a great rate on the room, and overall though it was a very good hotel in an excellent location. Would stay here again.
UR48713529	Always a good choice with a great location. However, I always feel there is something missing. Sort of vanilla feeling about the place. Good choice if you find a fair rate but not so special to splurge.
UR48222133	We stayed for one night, and found everything OK, Rooms all clean, a little small, but we expect this in London, Took advantage of the Club Lounge, and if used offeres excellent value. No compliants from us, all the staff we that help us was excellent Well done ! nice Hotel in good loacation
UR47616123	It is no use having spent a fortune on remaking this hotel if the staff let it down. The rooms are tastefully done and well-equipped - but very small even at the top end. The feel of a five star is there but everywhere there is poor service. The doorstaff talk to each other and cannot open a door; the reception staff are slow and have little or no guest recognition skills; the bar staff are almost totally arrogant. The housekeeping staff you encounter do try to be friendly. The upgrade they offer you to the Club lounge is not worth the money. Housekeeping is efficient but the turndown service is hit and miss. The overall effect is of a fine hotel that needs to start again with its staff.
UR47578520	I've been an Intercontinental Ambassador for about 3 years now and sadly this (subscription) programme just gets worse. I've thousands of Priority Club Points built up after many full price stays and yet they wouldn't allow me to make a rewards booking at this hotel - even though they had scores of empty rooms. I spoke to the hotel directly but they weren't the slightest bit interested. Take it from me - Intercontinental Ambassador Memberships isn't worth the plastic it's printed on. Sadly yet another "Hospitality" company dragged down by "Revenue Managers" who are frankly too thick and hard nosed to understand the meaning of the word. My advice: boot Intercontinental Ambassador Membership into touch the next time they come grabbing for the renewal fee.
UR47572621	Booked this as a part of a surprise Birthday weekend for my girlfriend. The hotel is grand and plush, however the service we got was terrible and not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.The staff need to work on their customer service skills and actually realise how rude they came across! My main gripe was that i had orgainsed champagne and strawberries to be in the room for arrival. No such luck. Rang reception 3 times and actually had to go down in person to speak to an extremley rude lady on reception whose attitude infuriated me. After all i had booked this as a treat for my girlfriend and the hotel were managing to spoil it. As we had the theatre to go to i asked that they left the champagne in our room for our return. Overall nice hotel,but bad service!
UR47000981	Stayed at this hotel and attended a function in their ballroom. Check in was quick and easy. I have stayed here once before approx 18 months ago and they welcomed me as a returning guest. I was given a room on the Club floor which is the 7th floor. Room was clean and comfortable with a spotless bathroom and great shower. The bed was extremely comfortable. Definitely what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. Everyone from the doormen to the conceirge were great. Only complaint is that the drinks were horrifically expensive. Â£4 for a diet coke in comparison to Â£11 for a glass of champagne. Think I'll stick with the champagne as it represents better value!
UR45589742	Stayed here for one night. The entire hotel has just been completely renovated, abs us very nice. I have stayed here before the renovations as well and it was good before but now it was more or less perfect. Highly recomended
UR45059254	We stayed at this hotel during a short theatre break to London using my points from my Priority Club membership. The hotel is in a great location on Park Lane just a few minutes walk from Hyde Park Corner underground station (just follow the signs to Park Lane using the underground subway). The hotel was impressive at first sight but the reception lady was a bit rude (this was the only time, all other people who worked there were really friendly). We had a standard king room and to be honest we were expecting more than we got, it was what you would get at any other 3 star hotel just with a fancier bathroom, robes (which was ripped), slippers and wall paper. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable with a turn down service at night, our view was onto the hotel so could not see out to Hyde Park. We did get a complementary anniversary cake and some oranges which was a nice touch. We did not eat at the hotel as it was Â£20 just for a continental breakfast so canâ€™t comment on the quality of the food. Overall it was a good stay but it would have been nice for the hotel to give us the â€œwow factorâ€� which it was lacking.
UR43075701	Stayed 4 nights in September 2009 at the Intercontinental London Park Lane. The hotel is overall very well kept and very clean. Before arriving in London I had a lot of e-mails with the Room Controllers to organize a birthday cake and the concierge desk for the transfers to and from the airport. Both very extremely friendly and helpful, really a great experience dealing with them. The day we arrived during the check in we have been informed that we were upgrade to and Executive Room: it was an amazing rooms overlooking Hyde Park. The room was very good: an entrance with a small table, a desk, a armchair and a king bed. The bathroom was ok, maybe a little bit too small for the Intercontinental standard but was very clean. Room was very clean. Staff is in the whole hotel extremely friendly and helpful. We had always breakfast the coffee book restaurant: the choice was very good with a lot of things. The location of the hotel is very convenient for leisure trip: 10/15 minutes on foot to Piccadilly Circus, 15 minutes to the National Gallery, 15 minutes to Buckingham Palace and about 30 minutes to Westminster Abbey/Big Ben. If you prefer the tube the Hyde Park station is 5 minutes on foot. One evening we had dinner at the Theo Randall restaurant, the food was amazing! I fully recommend this hotel of Intercontinental.
UR39935078	Got a great rate on priceline, I absolutely could not afford to stay here otherwise. On the piccadilly tube line for easy access to the city as well as Heathrow airport.
UR39864823	This was our second stay at this hotel since June 2009. The first was a holiday, this one a business trip. We were impressed the first time and even more so the second. We had a great prepaid rate and took advantage of a paid upgrade to Club access upon check-in. This went smoothly and the reception staff was not just competent but downright charming. Throughout the stay we felt a genuine interest in the quality of our stay, from the door men who were helpful without demonstrating any pressure for tips, to Guido the concierge who was informative and gave us solid advice on shopping and transportation (unlike the Rome Intercontinental). The Club supplement included Wi-Fi, a breakfast and â€œteaâ€� in the afternoon, and a â€œhappy two hoursâ€� drink. For breakfast we had a remarkable choice of cheeses, breads, eggs â€œthe way you like themâ€�, many hot and cold items from the menu, fruit, waffles ...My boiled eggs were perfect the first time and served with a smile. The service was excellent, efficient and â€œeffortlessâ€�. The Frette napkins and towelettes in the Club bathroom were a touch of class. One negative: Coffee from an automatic espresso machine in the Club was a complete disappointment â€“ folks this machine has to go!!! The room was a bit â€œspace efficientâ€�, but we did not feel cramped and two large suit cases fit easily and out of the way. The TV could be more up to date but it was a â€œbuilt in â€œflat screen and worked well. There was a very nice BOSE radio/alarm clock in the room, another expensive touch. The housekeeping was extraordinary and made up for any economy in room size. Every square inch of the floor was impeccably clean and the bathroom was spotless. On a Saturday morning we saw a young man walking cheerfully from one wall sconce to the next dusting/polishing them thoroughly with a cloth. This was really impressive particularly that they were nearly perfect to start with. For connoisseurs this hotel represents a great value for money especially with such favourable Euro/Pound exchange rate. We highly recommend this hotel.
UR38941638	Been for the second time to the Ic Londen and again a very good service! The Superior room has a partial view of Hyde park and is very small! Their must be a difference of 4 square meters ( Classic room 18 mÂ² , Superior room 22 mÂ² ) But their is no difference only the " view " . Normally their were 3 doorman two months ago but now non. Maybe they are saving ? But I will go their again if their is a promotion of something because the full price is really expensive !
UR38758214	Spend a week in late august last year at this hotel, this was my fourth time in 6 years. The staff is very attentive and always ready to help you at a seconds notice. Rooms are comfy and very clean. Nice television set, choices of movies and programs, Excellent minibar with lots of goodies for the late nighter. The Club Level has to be one of the best from the Intercontinental Hotels. A good size lounge, with cook to order breakfast or self serving buffet, a mix of arab and international food makes for interesting and savory choices. The staff of this concierge or Club level are the best I have encounter in many Club level visits. The hotel also has a nice bar and a very good fusion style restaurant, a bit pricey, but what is not in London. Picadilly Street is just across the hotel, as well as a beaufitul park and many of London's attractions withing walking distance. My experience was excellent and this will be my hotel of choice next time I travel to London Again.
UR38487286	We had a great deal here for 2 rooms, but it felt like since we received this price break, our stay would match the price. The location is good and the rooms are very nice.....however, this is not a 5 star hotel. We had just stayed at the IC Amstel and the San Fransisco Mark Hopkins, where they bent over backwords to help and make our stay pleasant. This is definitely a business hotel. We saw many people " doing deals" in the lounge, the restaurant..etc. They were catered too. The staff is nice but not very helpful. We saw the business patrons being catered to, while we felt secondary. There were almost no families, fair enough, but if you are a business hotel, make that more apparent in your adds. I called for turn down one time and never received it. ( At the Amstel, they not only came for turndown on a regular basis but left treats, water and other amenities ). I copied this from another review since it seemed to reflect my experience (This hotel might appeal to business travelers. Didn't see many other families. From other reviews it appears the suites and executive rooms are nice, and perhaps the staff is more accomodating to the patrons of those rooms).
UR37414574	I can't fault this hotel at all. Clean rooms, quiet and the staff were excellent.
UR36542547	We stayed here for two nights, Friday and Saturday. The room, althoughonly a standard, was a good size by London standards and very clean. Bed very comfy. Check in staff very friendly, as were the waiting staff at breakfast. breakfast was excellent with lots of variety. I would certainly stay here again.
UR36015414	I am a plat Ambassador I have stayed at the Intercontintal in London before and i must commend the Reception staff at check in and check out for being friendly and helpful. I received a double upgrade to a very nice room which was spacious, clean and a very comfy bed. The only complaint i have is that for the 2 days i had breakfast in the restaurant the service was terrible as in no staff and badly managed resulting in me having to beg for some coffee and also having my breakfast taken away whilst i was up at the buffet bar. Also the quality of food at breakfast has nosedived as last year it was outstanding but i did notice that the selections are less and the quality of products have been downgraded. But i would gladly come here again minus the breakfast
UR35372204	Arrived at 1.30pm could not check in until 2.oopm, fair enough. Went into lounge for a latte and cappuccino, bill was over Â£10. Lounge was nothing to write home about. Stayed at Intercontinetal in Muscat Oman many times which is a fantastic hotel, so perhaps the comparrisons are a bit unfair. It was a free nights stay so for the Intercontinental group to allow us this hotel was a bonus as we had booked to see a show at the Playhouse. The check in staff were efficient but no smiles and did not give extra information. We were upgraded to the business level which had a lounge, we had to find this out ourselves. The bedroom was adequate, bathroom very small. The cookhouse cafe was ok and breakfast had a good overall choice. At check in we were given a choice of paying Â£30 or booking breakfast then for Â£15 each.
UR35098364	A superior room at the IC London this summer is in the neighborhood of 500 to 600 dollars and the hotel is billed as a five star. So I am reviewing it with regard to its price and rating. It merits neither. The service is comparable to a standard four star US hotel like a Hilton. The hotel performs quite poorly compared to other IC hotels (I'm a Gold Ambassador member) that I have been to in Asia and even North America. Onto services. The concierge staff is overworked. The front desk staff is adequate, but nothing to write home about. It will surprise no one that room service is overpriced, but nearly $25 a day for Internet service is a bit much. Yes, even by the standards of an Intercontinental. The location is good if you want to be near Green or Hyde Parks, but I would recommend top hotels that are a bit closer to Piccadilly itself. On the bright side, however, Green Park is a major Tube stop, an intersection for three lines. The bottom line is this: there is nothing wrong with the IC London. But there is nothing very special about it either. This is not a five star hotel where people will know your name. Staff members don't really go out of their way to be helpful; even if they had the inclination, they might not have the time. It is simply not worth more than about $250 a day. If you're a leisure traveler and you are paying more, you are being ripped off.
UR34991734	I stayed here with friends and family as a birthday treat. From the outside, its quite an ugly building, but is in quite a nice, quiet location, on the edge of Hyde Park, very conveniently next to a tube station. We stayed in a suite with a double and two single beds, which also included a large bathroom, toilet, and a a lounge with a large TV, DVD player etc. Room was beautiful - classic decoration, nice art prints, very clean, well presented. Loved the Molten Brown toiletries, very nice. As arranged, the room was left with a bowl of fruit and gorgeous birthday cake, one of the nicest I've ever had! With fresh cram and strawberries in it. Found the suites to be quite modern - so good if thats the kind of thing you like. If you prefer more stunning, tradidional decor, go for something like the Ritz. The cleaning staff were quite rude but the actual hotel management and workers were very welcoming and business like. The bar staff were good too, I took my younger sister and they didn't seem to mind her running about and making mischief! The only thing is I don't know if its worth booking a quite unless you have serious money. I don't but I got a special offer through knowing a worker there. One night in a suite for around 4,000GBP - don't quote me on that though - is a bit much! If you have a lower budget, the smaller rooms are ok, but nothing special particuarly. I also stayed in one of the "budget" rooms on a seperate occasion, and don't think I would reccomend them. Overall, a very good stay however. Nice doormen too. I'd reccomend it to the well off, lottery winners and business tycoons. Maybe not my friends though!
UR34459038	Spent a week in London with my girlfriend from July 3rd to the 10th. After having taken a red-eye flight and arriving at 9 am, we were delighted that our room was ready and we're checked in immediately. Staff was extremely kind and pleasant. I can see why some people on vacation may have felt out of place as a lot of business people frequent the hotel. However, let me re-assure people, the hotel does a lot for tourists also! The concierge service was incredible! Caroline at the Concierge desk helped us navigate our stay in London and arranged some wonderful restaurants, great tips for shopping and sight-seeing, and arranged great last-minute tickets to Chicago at the Cambridge Theatre. A true 5 Star hotel, with an amazing location. My gf and I walked everywhere from the hotel. A stone throw away from the Hard Rock Cafe, about a 8-10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, and 8-10 minute walk to Picadilly Circus.
UR33625271	Wonderful stay at the fabulous Intercon Park Lane.This is a high class hotel with some really excellent service and the club floor is really really good with the main attraction being the breakfast which is absolutely above par.The rooms are extremely comfortable with fantastic music system from BOSE and television Bang and Olufsen, infact you will find B&O stuff all round the hotel. The hotel is very centrally located in the upmarket Mayfair area and the place to stay if you are in a mood to splurge i would recommend the executive room with club access. They have a very nice gym where working out is a pleasure, would recommend this hotel all the way and ofcourse one thing more the service is excellent .
UR33215386	We stayed here for the early May bank holiday weekend. We booked the standard room at Â£219 per night including breakfast, and as Royal Ambassadors, we were given a brilliant upgraded to a large suite. Our room was not ready on check in so rather than take a temporary room, we just went shopping and we were called about an hour later. We also took Club Intercontinental entry at a 50% discount - Â£40 plus VAT. This is probably our 5th stay here now and it gets better each time. The room was a very large corner suite. On entering, there was a dining area with table and chairs, guest bathroom, a living room with sofa, chaise longue and work/ business area, then double doors into a very large bedroom. There was a dressing area and a bathroom with double sinks and separate shower and about 20 big fluffy towels. The flat screen TVs are Bang & Olufssen and there are Bose Wave radios in the room. The rooms were also very bright and airy with 3 sets of windows and a nice view over Wellington Arch. Breakfast in the Cookbook Cafe was very busy and is a buffet, however the ingredients were quality with little cards telling you were the bacon, sausages etc have come from. We booked brunch for the Sunday, this was excellent value at Â£38ish as it includes unlimited champagne and certain cocktails. The staff work very hard and always keep your glass topped up! The food varies from Sunday lunch to fish dishes and lots of nice desserts. I would definitely recommend this! The Club Lounge is on the top floor of the hotel with floor to ceiling windows and great views over London. We had afternoon tea which was very nice and in the evening we went up for drinks and nibbles. We had cocktails in the bar later in the evening, we had a basil martini and a blueberry martini, and these cost Â£8 to Â£10 each, so reasonable value for a 5 star hotel in Central London. The staff do a turndown in the evening leaving water by the bed and the bed is just so comfortable. I had the best nights sleep ever. Check out was very efficient. Again, a brilliant stay and I have already booked to return.
UR32817363	The hotel was booked through 'Top Secret Hotels' 2 weeks before we were due to stay there. Incredibly we got a Saturday night with breakfast for Â£150. We arrived early ( 1100hrs). Room ready and check in very quick and dealt with efficiently. Hotel room lived up to expectations with all the little extras that make a 5 star hotel stand out. We used the room for a couple of hours and went out. Incredibly when we returned in the evening the room had been cleaned again. Excellent easy to use air con, along with the large and comfortable bed ( great pillows)ensured a great nights sleep. Breakfast choice was fantastic, fresh food and a relaxed environment to eat in. The staff throughout the hotel were attentive, friendly and all knew their roles within the hotel. The only negatives were that the kettle did not work properly in the room and the mini bar was extremely expensive ( Â£4.50 for a mini can of coke). The bar prices downstairs did not encourage you to make use of it. Regardless of the fact that it is a 5 star hotel it should not be charging Â£15 for a double gin and tonic. Joe Public do use the hotel from time to time ( special occasions) but that is just stretching the wallet too far.
UR32698820	We stayed here for one night in June for my girlfriendâ€™s birthday, using Priority Club points which meant we could book a Classic room for free (otherwise it would have been Â£300). On arrival, we were delighted to be upgraded to a Superior room in honour of her birthday, and then 5 minutes after getting into the room, a decorated dessert iced with a Happy Birthday message was delivered â€“ amazing service when we were getting the room for free already! Our Superior room overlooked the next door propertyâ€™s roof terrace and Hyde Park Corner and had all mod cons â€“ good aircon, fab shower, Bang & Olufsen surround sound TV etc. It was also surprisingly quiet considering the hotel's location close to a very busy junction in central London - didn't notice traffic noise at all. Service was excellent, friendly and attentive â€“ from the doormen to room service to the reception staff. We didnâ€™t eat in the hotel, but itâ€™s a very nice walk through Green Park past Buckingham Palace and down to the bottom of Haymarket where we had a restaurant booked. Afterwards we walked back through St James Park past the ponds then cut through Green Park again, thus avoiding all the traffic around Piccadilly. Would highly recommend this hotel if you can afford it â€“ or have sufficient Priority Club points like us! Would say it is far superior to the Holiday Inns of the same chain.
UR32006475	The Hotel is in a good location, 2 min walk from Hyde Park Tube. Friendly staff, Reception were excellent. We got upgraded complementry. The room was clean and had all the nice "extras" you would expect for a 5 star hotel ie Elemis products, CD player in room, Slippers, Turndown Service, Speakers in Bathroom to listen to TV,Bathroom mirrior that doesnt steam over, Additional large shower head, etc. We didnt eat in the Hotel but found a fab restaurant in Soho called Bistro. The food was excellent, service quick and friendly and great value for money. I would return to this Hotel.
UR31888535	This is a lovely hotel. Myself and my mum stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane to celebrate her birthday. We arrived at the hotel at 12 noon. We did not expect our room to be ready but we found the room was available for us (4th floor room 446). The check-in was fast and friendly. The room was lovely with two single beds a large flat screen TV and a Bose radio. The bathroom was a nice size and what a lovely surprise to have Elemenis toiletries and two bath robes. There were tea and coffee facilities, mini bar, and safe. After settling in our room we went out to explore London. On our return to the room my mum had a birthday cake and fruit left for her which was a lovely touch. We also had a turn down service every night with a little chocolate left on your pillow. Breakfast was Â£30 per person in the Cookbook CafÃ© or you could have Breakfast in the lobby for around Â£12.50. The breakfast was very good with plenty of variety. We had our evening meal at Theo Randall restaurant which was out of this world. The setting is stylish but relaxed, and yet again the staff our friendly and very attentive. I recommend you try this restaurant you will love it. We traveled by tube to the Hotel (Hyde Park Corner) from the tube it is no more than 5 min walk. I will 100% be going back to the Intercontinental Park Lane again and would recommend this Hotel to anyone.
UR31842965	The hotel is located within close distance and easy reach of the Hyde Park Corner tube station and it was clearly signposted at the station so we found it easily. We arrived at about 1pm - before check-in time, however our room was ready. The receptionist informed us that we had been upgraded to a room with a view over Hyde Park which we were pleased about. The lobby and downstairs areas in the hotel were lovely, it had a relaxed and welcoming feel. The bar area was smart and the chairs really comfy. Good first impressions. Our room was of average size - not huge but plenty of room for two people to be comfortable in. The bed was large and very comfortable. I noticed that the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, which is something I really feel is necessary when I am staying somewhere. The decor wasn't to my taste, however there was nothing wrong with it - just a case of personal preference. The bathroom wasn't massive yet of sufficient size and the shower was a rainfall shower - with the big shower heads. Toiletries, dressing gowns and slippers were also provided. Upon returning to the room on the first evening I found a birthday card from the hotel along with a slice of cake (absolutely gorgeous), some comice pears and a box of chocolates - I thought this a really nice touch. The rooms also get turned down each evening which is good. We didn't order room service, however if you wish to then bare in mind it is very expensive! One gripe I had with the hotel (only minor) was that although there seemed to be a lot of staff stood by the doors, they were very rarely opened for us, only a small thing but I would expect a 5* hotel to have someone on the door to welcome guests in. On the Friday night we ate in Theo Randall's restaurant - not cheap but worth it! We opted for the 5 course taster menu, each course being exquisite. I do need to make particular mention to the Amalfi lemon tart - the best I have ever had! The sommilier seemed to have a good knowledge of the wines and all the waitering staff were friendly. The restaurant had a relaxed feel which was lovely - you didn't feel the need to have a really hushed conversation - there was a good buzz about the place. One lady - perhaps the maitre d (?) - went out of her way to be helpful - we couldn't manage our cheese course so she arranged for it to be taken up to our room. She was very down to earth and made you feel really welcome in the restaurant. Overall I would recommend the Intercontinental as there is nothing at all wrong with it. I probably wouldn't stay here again if visiting London as I like to try new places but that is no bad reflection on the Intercon. Although it is a good hotel, I wouldn't say that it was extra special - it didn't 100% match up to other 5 * hotels I have stayed in. I have also stayed at the Marriott on Park Lane and I did prefer this. I would say if you were just looking for a base to do some sighseeing / visit London then it's perfectly fine - however it is a big hotel so for a special occasion I would probably recommend a smaller, more personal hotel. I get the impression it is mostly geared up to the tourist and business traveller.
UR31297658	What a wonderful experience this was. We stayed at the Intercontinental to celebrate my mother's birthday. The manager surprised her with a lovely bit of birthday cake and a plate of fruit in the room. We arrived at 10:00 a.m. to find they had a room available for us! The room was spacious, with two beds, and a large bath. Everything was clean, operational, and well thought out. There was an iron and board, two robes, Elemenis toiletries, large, flat screen TV, Bose radio, very effective black out drapes. The room and bath were spotless. There was a tea service, mini bar, and safe. Plenty of storage, plenty of room to move around. Very comfy chair and foot rest. We heard no street noise, no noise from the hall or neighboring rooms, including nothing through the door that connected inside to the next room. From the moment we walked in all staff were clearly there to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Service in the executive lounge was attentive and friendly. There were two free computers to use at your leisure. Breakfast had good variety and was tasty. We will absolutely stay at this Intercontinental again. What a pleasure to stay where you are pampered guests.
UR29721629	Our room was great -- nicely appointed bathroom with an amazing shower. Staff was fantastic, and very easy to get to from heathrow. 10-15 minute walk to bond street/picadilly
UR28995580	room upgrade -wonderful service - price/quality 10/10
UR28888025	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, along with my parents who are actually from England, and we were all extremely happy with this hotel. The service was excellent, the room was very clean with very nice furnishings, and the location was ideal. I have stayed at numerous InterContinentals, and found the London Park Lane to be one of the best - especially for the price. I would recommend this hotel for both first time visitors to London and for people who have spent a lot of time in London.
UR28645996	I wanted to rate this hotel as "4.5" here on TripAdvisor, but that's not an option. A perfect rating is also out of the question, so a "4" it is, with regret. I'd like to single out for special praise the pleasant and helpful attitude of the entire staff. They would collectively rate as one of the best I've encountered. This hotel is classified as a five-star property, and this review takes that fact into account. My feeling is that this is not quite a "classic" five-star in quality; it's no George V, Berkeley, or Four Seasons. Luckily, I paid four-star prices. Good: Location, room quality, bathroom, staff interaction, quiet room Not so good: Insulting costs for incidentals (wi-fi, minibar, phone), service hiccups, wi-fi access I had a room on the eighth floor in April 2009 (over Easter), booked through the opaque provider Hotwire, and I paid an average of USD $175 per night, inclusive. A month or two before check-in, I sent a personal letter to the manager indicating my several special requests. I was shocked to discover that each of my requests were accomodated (non-smoking, high floor, early check-in) even though I had booked through Hotwire (Hotwire/Priceline guests often receive less-desirable rooms in hotels). I was also upgraded to a deluxe room, though I did not request or expect it. The interactions (though not necessarily the results) with the staff were always pleasant and earnest, and I did not detect a hint of condescension even though I'm kind of a scruffy traveler. In fact, the desk staff who checked me in could not have treated me better. During the stay, service (though I did not need much attention) was somewhat lacking, and while that might be excusable in a lesser property, five-star hotels must be held to a higher standard. Even getting an ice bucket to the room promptly proved a challenge. However, these incidents were minor. On the flipside, management provided a complimentary plate of Easter sweets and (separately) a bottle of water. The room itself was rather nice (again, in context of a five-star property), well-appointed, but not fussy or over the top. Rather small for a five-star, the room was still large enough to feel less than cramped. There was enough storage space for my two bags, but there wasn't room for much else in the wardrobe (the only storage provided). As one would expect of a five-star, the room was quite clean. When the balcony door was closed, the room was very quiet, and I was never disturbed by outside noise (exterior, hallways, neighbors, etc). The hotel is in a decent location, and the Hyde Park Corner tube station is close by (although a flight of stairs down and up is involved to reach the station). However, there are not many dining/drinking options in the immediate neighborhood. If easy access to restaurants and pubs is important, then this hotel may not be a perfect choice. A brisk 20 minute walk will get one to Piccadilly, or Westminster, or other famous places in London. Hyde Park (itself) is next door, Buckingham Palace is a short walk away, and Harrod's about 15 minutes by foot or moments via tube. Across the road from Harrod's proper (on Brompton) there is a grocery store for those who like (as I do) to pick up some water, bread, drinks, or whatever to keep in the room. All the usual five-star amenities are present, including Frette linen, robes, slippers, a Bose radio, and a handily wall-mounted Bang & Olufson television. My room had a large balcony (I love balconies!), and from what I could see from the exterior, there are not many rooms with balconies. The programming is international, and in many languages. ESPN (american sport channel) is available, and the first time I have seen that in my international travels. The British TV channels are there, along with SKY news, CNN, and a few other English-language stations. Several electrical outlets are provided, and in various voltages and configurations (USA, Great Britain, and mainland Europe). The minibar is well-stocked; the pricing is shockingly high. It is an automatic device, so the guest is UNABLE to remove the items (to store their own purchases, for example) without being charged for them. Be careful not to accidentally remove an item. Don't use the in-room phone either. The charges are, like most incidentals in this hotel, insulting. The bathroom, though small, is well-fitted; the bathtub has the traditional hand-held showerhead and the always-appreciated "rainfall" showerhead as well. The water is quite hot, and the pressure is fine. Internet access, however, is a serious issue, and poorly handled at this property. There is no wi-fi available in rooms; wi-fi is only in the public areas. Worse, the charges for internet and wi-fi are OUTRAGEOUSLY and shamefully high. The charge is Â£5 (about USD $8 as of my stay) for ONE hour's worth of access, or Â£15 (USD $23) for 24 hours worth. The charge is the same for both wired in-room and wi-fi internet service. The public areas are very nice, and I enjoyed the (again, expensive) lounge. It is a comfortable, welcoming place. They also had the best macadamia nuts I have ever tasted (served with your drink). I did not dine at either of the two restaurants, nor did I breakfast at the property.
UR27875076	We re visited the Intercontinental on Park Lane during February 09. We stayed for the weekend as we had booked a meal at Gordon Ramseys resturant Murano's. We arrived on Friday lunchtime and we were shown our suite as it was ready. It was simply divine and very luxurious. The suite could not be faulted at all, view was over Aspley House as we had requested, extremely clean and well stocked with bathroom products - elemis. On Friday evening we dined at Theo Randells resturant which is the hotel - the food was fabulous and the service was impecable. We will definately return. The following day we were sightseeing and then returned to the hotel. That evening we dined at Murano's the food was fabulous and again the service was impecable. Overall the hotel service by the staff including the reception and the club lounge were excellent. We would recommend this hotel and hope to return soon.
UR27183474	I tried booking for the Intercontinental. We are a family of 2 adults and 1 child of 2 and a half and 1 baby of 7 months. They told me I cant have the children in the same room. How do they honestly expect me to put them in another room at that age!! The reservations were very rude and unhelpful.
UR27053616	Stayed at the Intercontinental when visiting London for my companies Christmas dance. Stunning hotel in a magnificent location on corner of Hyde Park/Park Lane. Very friendly and efficient check in staff - we arrived at 9:30 am and asked if we could store our luggage until a room was ready, but the staff member who was checking us in found a room and allocated it to us, albeit it only had a view into the inner courtyard. Hotel is very well appointed throughout from the reception to the corridors and lifts and is deserving of its 5* status. Rooms are very comfortable - not massive, but then who visits London to stay in a room! High quality BOSE TV/Sound system in room, writing table and good wardrobe/storage with iron/ing board etc. Bathrooms very modern with high quality fittings. And the bed - WOW!!! So comfortable. Didn't have a meal in any of the restaurants so can't comment, but buffet breakfast was was good. Drinks are quite expensive, but you are staying in a 5* hotel so that's only to be expected. Wouldn't hesistate to recommend hotel to anyone
UR26971743	We got an excellent deal on this hotel from Expedia and you can't beat the location. You are a quick walk from the Green Park tube stop and right across from Green Park. The hotel smells like roses when you walk in, which is a nice touch. The rooms are a bit small, but typical for London. We had to have a portable bed rolled in for our son, but they brought it up right away. The restaurant was okay, but go out to one of the local restaurants or pubs for a good English breakfast. My only complaint was that our television remote ended up missing twice during our 5 night trip, right after the maids cleaned the room. The hotel did bring up new remotes but it took them quite awhile to locate one. Overall though, it was a good experience.
UR26510870	I went here with my wife for a night! Absolutely top class. I'm a regular user of the Intercontinental group but this hotel is one of their best. The bar though was a bit crap but who stays that long in a hotel bar anyway! Perfect for couples or business.
UR26301342	Stayed in the suite in 2007 and 2008. This is a very good hotel, newly renovated (06?07?), clean and modern, expecially given all other hotels (inside the room) in London are pretty old. Quite area, very close to the underground, and the taxi are always there. 5 mins walk to Hyde Park and the underground. 15-20 mins walk to Harrods, very good walk (along Hyde Park) if the weather is nice. I will definately come back but only if I am on holiday. This is not a business hotel, the suites I stayed in 2007 (top floor) and 2008 (lowerest floor) are very pooly lit and the desk lamp is a joke. I have to moved all the standing lamps (one or two) next to my table and it's still not bright enough (against the dark wood/ deep colour background). Struggle to work / read and write/, under a very romatic atmosphere and I was only 34-35 then. I doubt if anyone can work under the candle light for more than 1 hour. It seems that the standard room are in lighter colour (yellow/beige?) and maybe the lighting will be more work-friendly.
UR26099323	We booked the Intercontinental on Park Lane as a treat for my husband's birthday and to go sales shopping, using our free weekend night certificate from the Ambassador pack. We booked a studio suite, however when we arrived they informed us we had been upgraded to a luxury suite (triple upgrade so we were very happy). Our butler took us up to the room, which was absolutely massive, especially considering the location overlooking Hyde Park Corner. There was marble floors, a guest cloakroom, large dining and sitting area, with a separate large bedroom and huge bathroom. Elemis goodies in the bathroom (and full size soap and moisturiser in the guest toilet). The Club lounge was being refurbished when we stayed, but the hotel had turned part of the ground floor bar and lounge into a Club area. The facilities Club access gives you is easily worth the extra money. There was everything you could want for breakfast in the Cookbook Cafe. Afternoon Tea in the lounge area with sandwiches made especially for us (we are allergic to dairy) and wonderful little chinese style tea pots with around fifty varities of tea was a lovely surprise. But the best bit was evening cocktail hour, we must have had more than a bottle of champagne between us, with choices of pink champagne or the classic champagne cocktail, who wouldn't? As the restuarant was closed, we had room service dinner, which was ok but nothing special. We didn't use the gym or spa but both looked brilliant, with individual new water bottles and rolled towels on every machine in the gym. As the Club lunge was closed we got free internet access in the business lounge. This is the only time I have stayed in an hotel and had my expectations surpassed. The service was perfect and staff were helpful beyond the call of duty at all times and extremely polite, without being at all fussy. There was even a chocolate cake wishing my husband happy birthday in the room when we arrived and staff knew our names and which room we were in whenever we had a query. I can't really express how great this hotel is, much better than the Hilton on Park Lane, or any other hotel I have been to. We will definitely be going back.
UR25563527	Fantastic hotel! Great location, great room (Executive suite). We always try and stay at Intercontinental hotels/resorts whilst travelling and yet again they delivered. The hotel is located in our favourite part of London, which is within nice walking distance of other hotels, bars and restaurants. The foyer and check in desk can be a little impersonal due to the size of the hotel, but highly recommended.
UR24588547	Stayed for a week here while at a course and overall the hotel was quite nice and good value. I had a club room which was a disappointment. The room itself was large and comfortable, but the bathroom was small and decrepit with a bath/shower combo that is not appropriate for a 5* hotel. The club lounge was the main problem i had with the hotel. Staff were bored and not that helpful, while food quality was poor. The fact that alcoholic beverages were only served between 6pm and 9pm reflected poorly on the hotel. If you are paying extra for the use of the lounge drinks should be complimentary all day, they need to take a leaf out of the ritz carlton's book. On the plus side, the club lounge itself is a nice room with fantastic view. Overall this is a good but not great hotel, i would not stay here again given the other options in London such as the Sofitel St James and the Renaissance Chancery Court
UR24526243	We stayed at the InterContinental Park Lane for one night on Feb 7th and once again it was excellent. The check in was quick and efficient. The staff are really helpful with any questions that you have and are not snooty as you may expect. We were dressed in jeans and trainers for a day out walking and were treated exactly the same as the people that had louis vuitton dripping from every pore. Rooms are so so comfy with comfy big bed, utter silence in the room - you can't hear noise from any other room. Location is great - tube stop within 2 mins walk, bus stop within 1 min walk and town centre on the doorstep. if you're feeling lazy its still only a Â£5 cab ride from leicester square at night. its also the perfect location for a sunday morning wander past buckingham palace (5-10 mins) to see changing of the guard at 11am and then along the mall into the shops
UR24470976	This hotel has a prime location in London City. Many sights are within easy walking distance or the Underground is only a few minutes walk down the road. The staff were very professional and the room cleaned impeccably. I can't comment on the hotel restaurants for we dined outside the hotel.
UR24403567	Don't stay in this hotel! Reception put me on the "Intercontinental Club" floor. When I went to use the Club, however, I was informed that if I actually intended to "use" the Club, there would be an ADDITIONAL charge of $200. During my stay I made a local call - when I checked out I was told that the hotel charges $5 PER MINUTE for a call to a local cell phone. When asked if I hadn't seen the tariff sheet next to my phone I advised that I didn't bother to look for such a card since it NEVER occurred to me that the hotel would charge $5 PER MINUTE for a call to a local cell phone. A collosal rip-off.
UR24204989	After staying at the Connaugh two nights because the Intercontinental I can report the Intercontinental is the better hotel. Staff is young and really work at taking care of you. The rooms are a good size and are intelligently thought out. Beds are very good also. The food could be better, but it is a commerical hotel. There are a lot of good restaurants around. This is a good location with Shepard's Gate close and only a 15 minute walk to St. James.
UR24125299	Idealy located infront of Park Lane. Walking distance from Picadilly, Harrods, Buckingham Palace and if 10 minutes walking is not too much for you ... you can arrive to London Eye and Big Ben without taking any taxi. Rooms are very nice, friendly staff. I originaly booked Hilton but I quited the hotel because it is very noicy because of the wind and the tall floors had this problem. Intercontinental just have 7 floors if I'm not wrong and you won't be able to see from the window of your room Buckingham and London Eye as in Hilton, but you will sleep very very pleasant. Just be warn to review your bill while quiting the hotel, I was charged with a Red Bull and a M&M that I never took :(. Absolutely recommended location
UR24097116	Having expected a weekend stay of luxury, we were very disappointed with the lack of personal service at this hotel. Our initial greeting was somewhat average and we were not even offered help with our luggage. The room was ok but definately not deluxe, there was lack of attention to detail in the room and there was various damage to the furniture and various lighting did not work. Having been asked if we wished to receive a newspaper and for it then not to be delivered was in our opinion not 5* service, why offer if you cannot deliver? Having booked several days prior to our visit to have dinner in the Theo Randall restaurant to find this was not done and then rebooking on our arrival to find that when we attended for dinner that we were still not booked in was somewhat upsetting and leaves you with a lack of faith in what should have been a luxury stay in 5* accomodation.
UR23621641	First time at this hotel, after numerous previous visits to London. From now on...I'll plan to stay here! The location is perfect --walking distance to many sights and lovely local neighborhoods. (Do not miss the nearby, but hidden, Shepherd Market area, wth its small pubs, restaurants, and shops, and Belgravia, and the walk down Piccadilly from the hotel). The hotel room, including the bathroom, is beautiful. Beds are superbly comfortable! Housekeeping is impeccable, with twice a day tidy/clean-ups and even slippers laid out by the bedside in the evening. The room and bathroom were always spotless. Unfortunately (for us, not him) Theo Randall's restaurant was closed for the Chiristmas-Boxing Day weekend, so we didnt get a chance to partake. The menu looked wonderful, and reasonably priced. Staff service--second to non,e anywhere!! Talk about going out of your way for a guest!! One of the staff, Malik, walked two blocks in freezing cold weather to help me bring luggage to the hotel. I'd made a wrong turn, and when my daughter went ahead, and mentioned this to him, out he wrnt wtihout even a jacket, to rescue me. I wish i could recall names of all the front desk and door staff. They ar alwasy ready with a smile and genuine courtesy--Malik, Husein, and others, thefront desk reception staff. The concierge desk deserves special mention. Bravo GUIDO!!! MILLE GRAZIE! He's an interesting, extremely knowledgeable gentleman who can answer all your questions, no matter how trivial they seem. If he doesnt know--he'll soon find out! He seems ot know everything about London. His colleagues Caroline and John are great too. To all the staff, and the GM, a huge thanks for providing excellent service in a beautiful hotel. The location of this place--in one of the exclusive areas of London--hasn't "turned their heads" or prevented them from offering professional, helpful, genuine and friendly service. Now that is REAL class!!
UR23530332	My wife, daughters (10 & 12) and I stayed for a bit over a week after Xmas thru the New Year. We had adjoining rooms, no view to speak of, but very comfortable for us. The hotel is really more of a 4 Star business hotel than a 5 Star deluxe, but it is well located -- 1 block from the subway and an easy walk to restaurants, Buckingham Palace and other sights. The service was attentive and pleasant, but had some trouble with English (mostly Eastern European) so the newspapers and coffee/tea service in the rooms was never quite right. And in the cold of winter it never seemed that there was a doorman at the door; they seemed to show up after you got there and started to come in. That said, a very nice hotel; good value for the location and quality.
UR23319502	We visited London for the NYE celebrations, as well as our 1-year anniversary. Upon receiving this hotel on Priceline, I emailed the hotel with information about our special occassion, and was informed that they would upgrade us to a Deluxe Room overlooking Hyde Park. Wonderful! Upon arrival at 10am, our room (742) wasn't ready, but we were invited to use the Club Lounge for the morning and afternoon until our room was ready. What a treat! Gorgeous views of the city, and a great spread of free foods and drinks. A wonderful way to relax after a long flight. We were given our room at 2:30pm, and WHAT A ROOM! Gorgeous decor, a stunning bathroom, super comfortable bed, and even a balcony overlooking the park. Service at this hotel was stellar, and employees here go out of their way to make guests feel welcomed. Standard rates are rather high, but for a full-service hotel on Park Lane in Central London, you're going to pay! We plan to visit London again in June and are thinking about booking a Club-Level room if we can swing the rates. Food and service in the Club is well-worth the extra expense. A great stay at a fabulous London hotel!
UR23279362	I booked a one night stay (New Year's Eve) at the Intercontinental London Park Lane indirectly via the Travel Republic website. This was part of a surprise, special New Year's trip to London for my girlfriend. I made the hotel aware of this via the booking form. The hotel, located at Hyde Park Corner, has recently undergone a major refurbishment and while the exterior is unlikely to ever to live up to some of the older, grander London hotels, I found the interior to be superb - contemporary luxury, without being too fussy or trying too hard. The doormen were welcoming and friendly; Jana on the check-in desk was helpful, efficient and friendly. My girlfriend and I felt immediately warmly welcomed and as if we personally mattered. We were given an upgraded room on the 8th floor, with views, which was in excellent condition. It was not a huge room, but I felt for London was probably good and it suited our needs perfectly. The club lounge facilities were also highlighted to us and we paid an additional amount to enjoy these as part of the hotel's New Year's package. These facilities are also available at other times too for an additional charge or are included with certain rooms. A special treat, in the form of a tasty dessert for two, was also delivered to our room gratis while we were out, which was another lovely touch. The breakfast the next morning was delicious and was taken in Theo Randall's restaurant. If there was to be any room for improvement, it would probably be around ensuring that breakfast items were always available, or at the very least with only very minor delays, and some items (glasses, plates, eggs, bread) were perhaps a little slow to be replensished at times. However, the staff did always appear to be pleasant and to be doing their best to resolve any issues as quickly as they could. On the plus side, this meant that the food always tasted fresh as it was never left standing for too long. All in all we had a fabulous stay and would very much enjoy a return visit I am sure. Intercontinental may be a chain, but the experience felt personalised and we have nothing but happy memories of our stay!
UR23160837	We just returned from staying at the Intercontinental over Christmas week. We had originally planned to stay at a short term apartment rental which ended up not working out, so we stayed at the Intercontinental at the last minute. We were able to get 2 connecting rooms as our children were with us. The man at the front desk was very accommodating and helped us configure the rooms in the most comfortable manner for our family of five. A cot was added to one of the rooms right away... The room's size was decent. However, the decor is drab and even looked tired to me despite the fact the hotel was renovated in 2007. The bathroom is not of a 5 star hotel quality...only one sink, the shower requires a shower curtain where the liner was already lined at the bottom with an orange mildew...as well, some of the grout between new tiles was already showing some orange mildew. The heating/cooling unit was extremely loud when it was running. The service at the cookbook cafe and the bar area was slow and expensive. Although, we really thought overall the food was good. In general, we had a good 8 day stay considering our circumstances. I just don't understand when people claim 5 star quality and it doesn't really exist here.
UR22529442	Outstanding hotel! We stayed here for a week from the end of November to the beginning of December and everything was perfect! Admittedly, we were supposed to be very busy that week in London, however we found ourselves coming back to the hotel early every day just to come back to our lovely room! It was such a lovely seclusion to relax in! The room was gorgeous, from everything from the bed to the view to the tv, the furnishings etc and the bathroom was such a refreshing retreat at the beginning/end of the day! The breakfast was one of the high points of the stay. English breakfast was included in our room rate, but we mostly helped ourselves to Continental breakfast which was delicious. The waiters/waitresses were very friendly and helpful. The reception staff were some of the most courteous we have ever experienced and all of the other details of the Intercontinental, such as the decor etc were all lovely. A perfect location too, as it's right at Hyde Park Corner and so accessible for Park Lane in one direction and Picadilly Circus in the other, and Hyde Park Corner tube station right outside the hotel. As a Londoner, this is an ideal location as most things are within walking distance and the Picadilly Line good for everything in Central London. Would love to come back again!
UR22354736	We spent three nights at the Intercontinental on Park Lane at the end of Nov 2008. It was a first time visit and we were very impressed. All the usual 5 star qualities you would expect, pleasant, efficient staff and a fantastic breakfast. The location is really convenient for both shopping and tourist areas so we were able to walk most places. Our standard room was sufficient for a city break - excellent, comfortable bed, great shower & lovely Elemis toiletries. We didn't eat at the hotel although we did read the restaurant menu (Theo Randall) & it sounds great. Had a few drinks which are expensive but there is a lovely atmosphere in the bar so good for a nightcap. Would definitely return!
UR21751872	Just spent Friday/Saturday 07/08 Nov at this hotel. The hotel is indeed luxurious, and in nearly all respects what you would expect from an Intercontinental. Check-in was smooth, efficient and friendly with Maria who by coincidence checked us out also. Being Ambassador members we were upgraded to an executive room with nice views of Hyde Park and also had late check out on Sunday at 4pm. A basket of fruit, box of biscuts and mineral water together with an invitation to an art gallery was sent to the room on Saturday. It was a very relaxing time at the hotel and gave a score of 4 because I had some issues with the Club lounge, lovely setting and very nice breakfast each morning..the downside not all staff entirely pleasant, the temperature of the area was a little cold not inducive to staying there very long, and the snacks/canapes well not an match to Abu Dhabi Interconti, could do with a better variety during the day and evening. Also for a tea drinking nation please learn the art of making a hot cup of tea!! Probably being a little picky, though don't let this put you off going there as the hotel is really very very nice. Location convenient to most sights, we walked everywhere and had no issues with the location.
UR21571736	i went few days ago in the bar of the internet continental hotel,and my experience was very bad. When we arrivals to the bar nobody said hello to us,after we sat in a table with still some dirty staff on it from the people who stay there before.After that we ha d to call the waitress to came to clean the table for us and finally we ordered. The drinks came after 20 min.our order and nobody cheque the satisfaction or offer to us something else. In my opinion that's definitly not what you expect if you go in a 5 star hotel plus with that prices!!!In the futur I will never book a room in that place for sure!
UR21494709	I booked a night at the Intercontinental, Park Lane with Priority reward points as part of my wifeâ€™s birthday celebrations which included the Orient Express to Paris. We often stay at the Holiday Inn, Mayfair but thought that even though they are in close proximity to each other we would spoil ourselves with a little extra luxury. Previous posts also gave me the impression we would be in safe hands. My only concern was the size and location of room that would be provided as we were using points, this was London after all. My worries were unfounded as our room was on a higher floor, with partial views of Parliament and Westminster Abbey and large. Iâ€™ve stayed in many hotels in London, some where you literally had to open the wardrobe door to turn over in bed at night, but this was spacious by any standard. A king size bed, lots of pillows and cushions, a sofa seating area with flat screen TV and Bose sound system clock, and even a fair size bathroom. After we had checked in the receptionist offered some advice regarding transportation to the station for our trip on the Orient Express the following morning. If nothing else it created the impression that they were aware of our itinerary and that we were not just another couple of guests. In my mind itâ€™s usually the simple things that are appreciated more. A long day spent walking around London encouraged us to indulge in a couple of nightcaps in the hotel lounge. Typically expensive, but this was part of a weekend where we were prepared to spoil ourselves and remind ourselves why we work hard for a living. Although it was quite busy the bar waitress was attentive and our service was courteous, not surly in any way. The prices however were expensive, Â£10 for a 175ml glass of wine and Â£11.50 for a spirit, ouch, but again it wasnâ€™t our intention to count pennies on this trip. When we returned to our room the usual turn down service had also left a bottle of mineral water, a fruit bowl, a packet of chocolate biscuits and a birthday cake for my wife, a lovely touch. As stated earlier itâ€™s usually the little touches that are appreciated. Overall just what I had hoped for from an Intercontinental Hotel on Park Lane. Would I recommend it? Yes, if your pockets are deep enough. Would I stay there again? Probably not, for no other reason than the Holiday Inn, Mayfair is more reasonable in terms of cost, comfort and location. However, as a starting point for a weekend of luxury and spoiling ourselves it was excellent, and if we were to plan a similar trip again, I would return.
UR21160370	Where to start??? The planning involved with this 4 day weekend consisted of months of planning and arranging and all with the fantastic help of Alixandra from the Hotels Concierge division. She had no idea when we were going or even where we were going. She only knew that I loved her and was someday going to ask her to spend the rest of her life with me. I took her right from her work; bags already packed in the car and passports in hand. We flew into Heathrow in London dropped off our luggage for trip to the hotel, and then we picked up our next flight which she knew nothing of to Paris for the day. I asked my beautiful phenomenal girlfriend to marry me on the Eiffel Tower after touring the finest of areas and hot spots of Paris that were all recommended by Alixandra and the other staff that she consulted with. We then took first class tickets on the Chunnel train back to London and both of us wanted to get to the Hotel, but little did we know what we were going to experience! Roses throughout the rooms and on the master bed in the shape of a large red heart, and champagne on ice had all been prearranged and were done magnificently. On top of this Alixandra had arranged for 2 large bars of dark chocolate, fresh cheeses, biscuits and strawberries. Alixandra also arranged for us to be upgraded to a single bedroom suite that cannot even be described. The workmanship and the detail to cleanliness cannot be compared. There were no details missed in this room or the hotel. They also arranged for us to have VIP passes to the 7th floor private members club where we enjoyed a spectacular selection of foods throughout the day and service that could not be challenged. The Suite was one we will never ever ever forget. The mirrors in the bathrooms were even heated so they wouldn't fog up if you were to enjoy the rain shower or the oversized bathtub. The daily paper being delivered in its own little satchel was as nice a touch as obtaining the daily weather reports and other fresh extras every day. The amenities were more then even I could have dreamed of giving my dream girl. The Bose stereo system and the B&O flat screen TV's were a great closing touch to a superior quality room. The view from our suite on the 7th floor was breathtaking of the park, Big Ben and the London Eye. The fresh slippers each day and oversized robes cannot easily be forgotten nor could the high quality toiletries that were automatically replenished each day. We would have stayed for weeks if we could! When we travel we always try to stay in the finest of locations within our budget and we strive to always get the best of service that we can but this was and might never be matched again. Alixandra arranged for everything perfectly and she left no small detail unturned. The staff throughout the Hotel cannot be compared to any other location that we have ever attended. The maids, doormen, servers, front desk were all so friendly and you couldnâ€™t stop thanking them enough, This was a life changing holiday extended weekend full of love and romance and this was more then any couple could ever expect or even deserve. I want to thank Alixandra, the Hotel and all of their terrific staff for making this a weekend one that we will hold to our hearts for the rest of our lives together. We were stretched to go their financially with flights and all but it was worth every pence and they will see us back again. (That is a promise!!!) Thanks to all involved for making this the most spectacular weekend of both of our lives!!!! We truly appreciated every little detail... Stephen and Gordana
UR20961806	I should start by saying I feel a little bad about writing this review but think it is worth mentioning so that people have an honest understanding and expectation. I'll start by saying the Intercontinental set of hotels are simply great. I have been staying with them and am an Ambassador level guest so I clearly put my money where my review is. The London Intercon is in a fun area of the city and offers a great morning walk to the office or city for work. If you're heading to Big Ben area you can walk right down the main causeway and past the Palace which kicks the day off in a wonderful way. It also is positioned well for a great walk after a long day and a few pints with you "mates". The hotel physically is well appointed and the staff very friendly. On my stay there were complimentary tickets to the Royal Galleries (although I did not have time to use them). So, all the basics are covered and covered well. My disappointment was with the room choice. I guess I was expecting that being Platinum and Amabassador with the Intercon for so many years I would not be put in a small room on a lower floor without access to the standard business lounge. It is probably an oversight by the booking or front desk people but it's one that is costly. For those staying 50+ nights a year with a hotel chain you expect / grow accustomed to the hotel being your home away from home. This is the major failure of this transaction. My second point of contention, which I will admit is minor but none the less annoying, is the flat rate at which points are accrued for staying at the Intercon. For some reason it has been determined that regardless of how much (and it is a lot) you spend on a stay (for a day or in my case 5 days) you simply get 2000 points. To put that in perspective - you need 25k to stay at a basic Holiday Inn property. So, my gripe is that in exchange for $2200+ for a few nights I got a bill slipped under my door. The other HI properties would have graciously deposited 22,000 points and then bonused it up another 11,000. This would have allowed a frequent traveler like me to either extend a vacation another day, have the in-laws stay comfortably "over there", etc. So, If you're not a point person or a frequent stayer - go here and enjoy. If you're a marketing person from Intercontinental surfing the web trying to figure out "the voice of the customer" read this review again and then match the dates and story with the emails I sent to the Customer Service team. You'll be able to find me and call me. For the record: "yes, it is all about the points"!
UR20749758	I've just had a stay where I found the washroom to be the most luxurious. Who thought there could be so many ways water can come out for a shower at the same time. The rooms were properly made however it seemed like they try to predict the time when you would be out of the room - sometimes they are wrong. The first day I was there, my room was not made when I arrived back at 5 to freshen up for dinner. After I put the "please make room" sign on my door knob my room was made everyday between 2-3pm and someone actually checked up if I was satisfied with my room. My room was made again around 8pm for the "night time" mode. As for location, it is not actually that convenient. Picadilly Circus is a 30 minute walk and the closest convenient store about 15 minutes. Essentially most tourist sites requires a change on the tube so that was a bit annoying as well. I did ask some locals and it seems everything requires a connection. Lastly, maybe because this is a 5 star hotel and they wish to wait on you hand and foot but I'm someone who doesn't like to wait and if I need to dial room service for 3 cubes of ice for a drink, I'm a bit put off.
UR20459389	We stayed 2 nights recently and had an enjoyable stay. We were in a standard room which was nicely presented with superior furnishings and quality 'Bose' and Bang & Olufsen' electronics in the room. The standard room we had wasn't huge but the bed was comfy and the bathroom was of a good standard. The hotel is in a great location with easy access by tube (Hyde Park Corner), taxi (Â£10 from Euston Station) or walking (15 minutes to Piccadilly) and the services within the hotel - Room Service, Gym, Restaurant, Bar etc are all excellent. We'd recommend staying there and would stay there again on our next trip to London.
UR20459288	Stayed at this hotel for a weekend while visiting London. It really was a great experience. Sometimes I find the big hotel chains are a little soulless and impersonal but at the Intercontinental Park Lane this couldnt be further from the case. Staff are sincerely friendly and always willing to help, in reception, concierge and restaurant. The public areas of the hotel are very clean and relaxed and the room we had was large, clean and modern. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Well done Intercontinental!
UR20423175	A few days in London to sight see on our way home from a trip to Italy. The Intercontinental was the perfect hotel experience. I'm always searching for hotels with updated exercise facilities. The gym at this hotel has everything you need for a good workout and the location is ideal, situated in between Hyde and Green Park. Some of the rooms are small, however we requested an outside room, which was a bit larger. We loved the decor, the bathrooms were clean with a rain shower head. The conceirge was friendly and always full of great suggestions. The restaurant staff were fun and eager to please. This hotel is great for business travelers and couples looking for quiet rooms with great service. I was overwhelmed by how friendly the staff was. There is an upbeat, yet mellow mood throughout the hotel.
UR20402543	Two stays at this property in the last couple of months, and we loved it. Wonderful airy club lounge with a great view south over London through high windows. The lounge serves a great breakfast - hot options as well as cold, and various tidbits through the day. Complimentary champagne at 6pm. Really comfortable beds in the suites, cushions galore, and the bathrooms are very nice too. The staff were great. Walk straight out of the hotel for a stroll in Hyde Park or off shopping in Knightsbridge.
UR19956515	Booked on Hotwire for 5 nights at $215 per night. The hotel is beautiful, the service excellent, the rooms luxurious and the location is in the middle of everything. Don't expect much of a view for the Hotwire price and, if you are on a budget, try not to buy anything in the hotel (e.g. a cup of coffee was about $9 when we were there)
UR19956020	My husband and I stayed in a Classic Room for the weekend. We paid Â£200 inc VAT for both nights. We did enjoy our stay, the room was comfortable but decorated in a woolly, traditional style (but with no charm!) The room was well equipped though, and we had Bang & Olufsen TV and DVD player. The only bad points are the room size is small (18 feet) and there is a shower curtain - which I have never experienced in a good hotel - you can't really enjoy your shower as the shower area is so small and the slimy curtain gets in the way. Everything else about the room was great, location was perfect, we walked to Oxford St, Edgware Road, Mayfair etc the staff were great. Would visit again but would not pay anymore. If I wanted to pay more, I would opt for a more fashionable room in the The Waldorf, Aldwych.
UR19620035	My daughter and I enjoyed 4 nights in a standard room at the Intercon Park Lane. Service was excellent throughout the stay. There was some trouble on check in 'finding' our room - the hotel was so full, but we were treated to drinks in the bar while an appropriate room was found. Other examples of great service - we were waiting at the concierge desk to enquire about theatre tickets while another guest was being served. After no more than one minute, someone from the check in desk came over to assist us. Another time, I sat in the lobby and waited while my daughter ran up to the room for a forgotten item. An employee came over shortly after I was seated to enquire if there was anything I wanted. All employees offered attentive, friendly service. The room had a view of Hyde Park, had very high quality linens, ample towels and amenities, and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Absolutely no noise from the street unless, of course, we chose to open the window. The room had plenty of space for all our bags. Comfortable chairs for relaxing and watching TV after a long day of sightseeing and shopping were appreciated. We ate breakfast each morning in the restaurant at the hotel. I had the 'continental' buffet. Pricey, but very good selection of breads, rolls, muffins, fruits, juices and cereals (they were happy to prepare hot cereal on request), good coffee (essential in my mind). My daughter ordered a la carte. We had the same selection each morning - creatures of habit - so when I checked out, I noticed and pointed out that one day they didn't charge enough and another they charged extra. WIth an apology, they removed the entire charge for the breakfast that was overcharged and didn't up the amount for the undercharged breakfast. This impressed me and was a nice touch for an apology - definitely going the extra mile to correct. The location is no more than 2 minutes from the Hyde Park Corner tube station on the Picadilly line. We took the tube everywhere, day and evening, and this stop is handy for getting to most tourist sites. We enjoyed being right next to Hyde Park and walked through the park on several occasions. I will definitely stay at this hotel again, well worth the price.
UR19315363	Rooms were amazing, bed super comfortable and bathrooms very clean and modern. Hotel itself was clean and modern and friendly service. Of course with any high-class hotel, the food and drink were off the charts so we ate elsewhere. 5 minute walk from Hyde Park Corner tube station, up and down stairs so can be a bit tiring if you have large luggage. Nobu restaurant (one of London's best reviewed Japanese restaurants) is right across the street. For shopping, we took the Tube a couple stops away to Piccadilly and Oxford. Knightsbridge is only one stop away. If we have the budget, we'd love to come back here again.
UR17411516	The Intercontinental London Park Lane is conveniently located across the road from Hyde Park Corner Underground Station on the Piccadilly line. The entrance foyer is rather cramped and the two door men were too busy talking to each other than helping us with our luggage or opening the door. As you enter the main lobby you have to immediately go down a small number of steps to reach the main reception. The main lobby is pleasant enough but not particularly grand like a number of other five star hotels. Although it has only just been refurbished, the design gives the impression of a luxury hotel from the late 70â€™s, very nice quality but rather dark and small. Please donâ€™t let this initial part of the hotel put you off, after all it is only an entrance and without knocking half of the building down and starting again it would be very hard to make any major change here. The Priority Club check-in desk is to the left of the reception desks. The reception is immediately in front of you as you enter, to your right is the Theo Randlle Italian Restaurant which has received excellent reviews but we didnâ€™t use on this occasion. To your left is the concierge and guest relations desks and in the far left is the main bar and another brassiere style restaurant. We approached reception and were immediately welcomed by a member of staff. Prior to our arrival at the hotel we were emailed a questionnaire asking all about our trip, any extras that we may require, magazines, butler, flowers, restaurant reservations etc. This I thought was very good. The member of staff informed us that we had been upgraded from the 1 Bedroom Suite that we had booked to a 1 Bedroom Luxury Suite. We were given our key cards, a quick explanation that we could use the Club Intercontinental Lounge on the 7th floor and shown to the lifts. We werenâ€™t accompanied to our suite and no assistance was given with luggage however we did only have two small overnight bags so it wasnâ€™t really needed. We arrived at our suite (room 410) on the 4th floor, the electronic key card to open the door worked first time (quite a challenge for some hotels I assure you!). On entering the suite there is a small hallway with a guest bathroom (toilet and vanity washbasin together with a large bottle of Elemis Hand wash and Elemis Moisturiser), small round table with a box of tissues. Opposite the guest bathroom is a full length mirror and an area for baggage, etc. Further into the suite is a dining table for four persons, on the table was a welcome card from the hotel manager, a box of Duchy of Cornwall biscuits, a small bowl of fruit and a 750ml bottle of English still water. Next to the dining table was a desk with the normal internet connections, multi line phone etc; in the drawer was a WIFI repeater to ensure a good internet connection. The dining area leads onto the main part of the living room consisting of a nice comfy sofa, two arm chairs and a floor lamp together with a coffee table and two side tables. These are positioned around a very nice wood panelled wall unit with a built in 32â€� Bang & Olufsen LCD TV, a separate Bose Wave Sound System and Bang & Olufsen DVD Player. The TV has various languages; English, Czech, Danish, German, Russian, Estonian, Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Finish, Swedish and Turkish. The TV has the following channels: BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky News, CNN, BBC News Channel, BBC World, Bloomberg, CNBC, Al Jazeera International (English language), Sky Sports 1, Sky Sports 2, Sky Sports 3, Sky Sports News, Eurosport, Al Jazeera Sports 1 (Arabic), Al Jazeera Sports 2 (Arabic), Dubai Sports (Arabic), Quatar TV (Arabic), Saudi 1 (Arabic), Saudi 2 (Arabic), Dubai TV (Arabic), Abu Dhabi TV (Arabic), Al Arabiya (Arabic), Al Jazeera (Arabic), MBC, MBC 2, TV 5 (French), Das Erste, ARD (German), LBC (Arabic), Rotana Musica (Arabic), CBBC, C Beebies, Rai Uno (Italian), TVE International (Spanish), RTP International (Portuguese), ERT Sat (Greek), RTR Planeta (Russian), TRT International (Turkish), JSTV (Japanese), CCTV 9 (Chinese), PCNE (Japanese). Internet can also be accessed through the TV using the wireless keyboard at a charge of Â£27 for a 24 period for unlimited use of Movies on demand, Music on demand (separate to the Bose Wave sound system which is free) and internet through the TV. The coffee table in front of the sofa had the selection of magazines we had requested on the pre stay questionnaire plus a couple of extra ones, all current issues. The view from the living room window was amazing; we looked directly down onto Wellington Arch, The New Zealand War Memorial and Hyde Park Corner. The living room has a nice thick double door (walnut wood) leading through to the bedroom. The bedroom has a large King Sized bed, attractively decorated with many large pillows. The sheets were of excellent quality, the bed had down comforters and were very comfortable. The bedroom also had its own Bang & Olufsen LCD TV again built into a wooded wall unit. There was a large mirror hidden behind a little door in the wall unit and this could also be utilised as a dressing table. Next to the bed was a second Bose Wave Sound System which also acted as the bedside alarm clock and radio. The bedroom lighting was very good, two bedside lamps, over head reading lights and even a little night light next to the bathroom door built into the floor (can be turned off). The bedroom had the same view as the living room. There was also a good sized wardrobe, build in drawers, ironing board, a proper hairdryer, laptop safe, valet box with shoe shine bag (leave outside for complimentary shoe shine), laundry bag and shoe horn. There was another small area for luggage to be left. The bedroom leads onto the bathroom area. The bathroom had a large bath with a good ergonomic design which supported you whilst bathing, the bath had a build in handheld shower head should you wish to wash your hair whilst in the bath. There was a double vanity unit, a separate shower cubicle with rain head shower, a toilet and bidet. There were copious amounts of Elemis Toiletries, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap. These were all in 100ml bottles and we had 3 of each type. There was a good amount of towels, large bath sheets, floor mats and two large robes. Once we had unpacked we headed up to the Club Lounge on the 7th Floor. Club Lounge access is free for all guests residing in a suite. For non suite guests there is an additional charge which is listed on their website. The lounge has its own reception desk leading into a hallway with male and female toilets (again Elemis Toiletries) and a separate shower room for those arriving early when the room isnâ€™t ready. As you turn left you enter the main part of the Club Lounge, the ceiling rises and you are greeted with an excellent view of Wellington Arch and Hyde Park Corner from the large floor to ceiling windows that run the entire length of the room. There are different seating areas including sofas, more formal dining tables and individual stools against a runner like in a coffee shop. The Lounge has three computers (two windows laptops and one apple notebook) with complimentary internet access. There are two large plasma screen TVâ€™s with sofas facing them at opposite ends of the lounge, these were showing Sky News on our arrival but they could be changed if you ask the staff. At the far end of the lounge is a library area with a good selection of magazines and travel books together with national and international newspapers. In the centre of the lounge is a raised area with the complimentary buffet. Coffee and Tea (loose leaf and many varieties) are available all day either by self service or by asking a member of staff. There are also fridges with very nice fresh fruit juice, water and other soft drinks. You could ask for other drinks from the staff. A selection of nibbles, crisps, nuts and rice crackers were always available. There was also a selection of small cakes and biscuits available next to the coffee. A lunch a selection of sandwiches with various different fillings are put out and regularly replenished together with a good selection of cakes. At 1500hrs afternoon tea is served with a help yourself selection of sandwiches, cakes, tea cakes, scones, James and cream. Tea and coffee can be made by a member of staff if asked. All were very nice and you could help yourself to Complimentary champagne. At 1800hrs an evening selection of nibbles, olives, crisps together with a full bar (help yourself again!) and hot canapÃ©s such as tempura prawns, chicken satay and even club sandwiches were served, together with a selection of cheeses with biscuits and cakes. There was enough to fill you up if you werenâ€™t particularly hungry. After afternoon tea we went back to our suite to find a member of staff had delivered two glasses of ice cold champagne, a bowel of fresh strawberries and a lovely chocolate birthday cake for my partner. There was another bowel of fruit and more water together with a small birthday card from the hotel staff. We only had one very small problem with the room and that was the overnight pack supplied in the bathroom with razor and toothbrush inside had been opened by the previous guest and then placed back on the shelf. Personally I blame the previous occupant for putting it back on the shelf and not disposing of it. We mentioned it to the Club Lounge host and asked dif we could have a new one. When we returned that evening not only was the overnight kit replaced but there was a written apology from the Housekeeping Manager and a box and very nice chocolate truffles. We didnâ€™t expect this at all and it was a very nice gesture. I just hope the member of staff didnâ€™t get into trouble. We had an excellent nightâ€™s sleep, no noise at all despite being at Hyde Park Corner. Breakfast the next morning was served in the Club Lounge. A nice selection of fresh fruit and fresh pastries was served together with the normal continental selection of meats and a good cheese selection. You could also order hot food with the lounge host, my partner tells me the poached eggs were the best he has ever had served with bacon and tomatoes and a round of toast. There are no breakfast menus around, so ask for any cooked selection. The lounge staff were very friendly and helpful, we were allowed a late checkout at 4pm and we were then offered the use of the Club Lounge for as long as we needed as our train was departing late. Overall an excellent hotel, good position, good service and good value for money compared to other London hotels. It is a big improvement of the Intercontinental hotels that London used to have.
UR16513011	One of the better 5 stars we have stayed in . Got to London at least once a year and will use this Hotel again. The phone line charges for a local call at really high and defeat the purpose of prepaid cards (ie 1.5 pounds plus .5 pounds a minute up to 5 pounds)
UR16138074	We were attending an event and had booked to stay an additional night. Our booking was lost. Room was not cleaned the next day so at 18:00 they asked us to go away while they cleaned it. Paid on departure, they lost the payment. Contacted my husbands company looking for payment, saying he had not paid. 7 phone calls and 23 emails later I would have to confirm that the customer service is dreadful.
UR16135519	As part of my sister's birthday celebrations, my mother, sister and myself spent a day shopping in London and were booked in for afternoon tea at the Park Lane Hotel. At first, we went to the wrong hotel so be careful not to walk past the front door as we did! When we first walked in, the decor and atmosphere were lovely and tranquil but there didn't appear to be a specific reception desk so there was some initial confusion because the gentleman/doorman who greeted us didn't seem to know what we were talking about. Nevertheless, we got over this initial hiccup and we shown to the Palm Court, which is just a wonderful example of Art Deco with a fantastic high, arched glass ceiling and other features. We were shown to our seats, right next to the harpest, and sank into huge, soft sofas amid dimmed lights and an airy atmosphere. The service was impeccable; attentive without hassling us, friendly without being overbearing and we felt like queens. We opted for the Art Deco Afternoon Tea, which included a glass of champagne. The whole experience of afternoon tea here was wonderful with a list of different teas as long as your arm, dainty finger sandwiches, a variety of scones and preserves and patisserie that are almost too pretty to eat. At approximately Â£45 per head, you might think that it's not worth it for afternoon tea but we were given second helpings of sandwiches and stayed for about fours hours! They must have been glad to get rid of us but they certainly didn't show it! The perfect way to recharge after a successful shopping trip.
UR15970078	I booked the Interconty Park Lane for my boyfriend and myself to spend the weekend for his bday. It was an added encouragement that at the time I worked for the company so got a hefty discount - which I know I was really lucky to get - but even so, I think I would have paid full price for how great it was! Location: right on Hyde Park corner. Overlooking both parks. On the road that leads to Piccadilly Circus, but due to the triple strength windows, you couldnâ€™t even hear a car horn. Great for getting to the West End and for the shops or Kensington. With my BF being a Geordie, he had never been to London, so this hotel was great for showing him all sides of it. Hotel: Was very luxurious in the foyer area and the doormen, everyday, were so polite and was rushing to help you whether you were dripping in Armani or not. They offered us umbrellas in the Awful (!) weather that we experienced there too. I think we were upgraded on check in but if we was we wasnâ€™t told, it is only my assumption. The room was spotless! Absolutely perfect. Massive TV and HUGE bed! Bathroom was amazingly clean with a bath and power shower. Some nice touches in the room that you donâ€™t get everywhere, bathrobes, toiletries, tissues. There was also a really comfy lazy chair and desk Housekeeping was very polite. All the staff seemed smiley and friends - if any department was the least friendly, it was reception! This was a surprise! On my boyfriendâ€™s actual birthday, we returned to our room to find a chocolate cake with a happy birthday message on there, especially from the hotel. Concierge looked after us really well. Any question- they had the answer - very professional. They even organised us on the guest list for a club, and next morning when they saw us, asked how it was! Was really lovely they remembered us! Price for alcohol and mini bar was sky high, but then it is 5*, it is London, but even in my estimation, Â£20.00 for two shots of Vodka and 1 can of coke is steep! Out of it all, the only thing I disliked was most the other guests staying there. For instance, we left on the day that there was a huge parade for St Patricks Day and one guy, who thought just cause he was wearing shorts and sunglasses (in the awful pouring rain might I add!), could shout to high heaven at all the staff he could see that it was going to take him an hour longer to get to the airport for his flight due to the parade, and that they should have made more effort to make him aware! If you can stomach people like that, who look at anybody in last seasonâ€™s fashion with their noses turned up, then please go to the Interconty. My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful weekend, despite the rain, and it was made even more special by the way we were treated and looked after by the fabulous staff there. We would like to return and eat at Theo Randallâ€™s one day! All in all 5* Staff in a 5* Hotel, what everyone wants for their money!
UR15548714	I stayed here for just one night with my son (17) in a twin room - I'm not actually sure what standard room it was as I used Priority Card points to 'pay' for it - but it was excellent! Superb quality linen, towels, gowns and slippers. High quality toiletries, plenty of tea / coffee and a Bang & Olufsen TV and a Bose wave system (can't be bad!). The bathroom (especially the huge shower head) was superb. I had booked a twin (obviously with my son in tow!) and we had a Queen but this was soon zipped apart and the beds re-made while we were out later that evening. The breakfast was absolutely superb - the best quality fresh fruits, yogurts and pastries and my son enjoyed the omelettes and hot buffet. the location is excellent with 2 tube stations close by (1 is a two minute walk via the underpass and the other a 10 minute walk). Hard Rock Cafe is literally on the door step, but we ate dinner at Automat on Dover Street in the evening (10 minutes walk away) and at Richoux for lunch (15 minutes away). Faultless - I would certainly stay here again! All my 'picky' needs were catered for!
UR14766798	The hotel's location is unrivalled. You can walk through parks to Knightsbridge, to Buckingham Palace, everything else is also in walking distance. If you opt for the tube or a bus, it's just around the corner. Can't be more convenient. The hotel is brand-new inside. Modern chic, fashionable. They cannot do anything about room sizes, of course. The building is from the 70s. So are the room sizes. But they are okay, just average. Breakfast is also good standard, but lacks what I expect from a 5* hotel-but, well, this is Britain, this is London. There is no sparkling wine, the what they probably call a European roll is downright inedible. But there is a choice of breads and there is an impressive choice of really fresh fruit. Compared with other hotels in London of a comparable standard, I definitely recommend the IC. The cost-effectiveness is - again! for London or the UK- really good.
UR14751429	The Intercontinental London Park Lane Hotel is a super efficient, luxurious hotel with beautiful rooms and bathrooms and provides every comfort for a five star London experience. The executive rooms are beautiful and the added use of the executive lounge is very enjoyable in terms of a lovely lounge on the seventh floor that gives a great view of Marble Arch and Hyde Park. In fact the Intercontinental Park Lane is in a very advantageous position for visiting London - Hyde Park is on the doorstep for walking and it is right next to the main shopping areas of Oxford Street and Bond Street plus near enough to walk to Knightsbridge and museums and Piccadilly and theatres. Behind the hotel is an area rich in cafes and small winding streets and shops. The staff are super friendly and very kind. We thoroughly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure. Breakfast is very good too.
UR14538701	A single woman on vacation I stayed at the Intercontinental Park Lane in London. Perfect Stay. I had everything but a butler.The concerige set me up with a guided tour with Evans and Evans for Windsor , Stone Henge and Oxford. Loved loved loved it!
UR14501085	Excellent holel stay during a recent trip to London for my wife's birthday. I could not fault this hotel for the service, rooms, or food (we ate in the hotel resturant, Theo's - exceptional Italian style). I have stayed in London many times for business and pleasure. After our experience I doubt I will stay anywhere else.
UR14484696	A great hotel situated right by Hyde Park. I was a bit worried it might be noisy in the rooms due itâ€™s location next to a busy roundabout, but decent double glazing kept any disruption out â€“ I didnâ€™t hear a whisper. The buffet Breakfast was fantastic â€“ all sorts of great food, with freshly made fruit smoothies, freshly cooked eggs, pastries and more. You can have breakfast in your room for the same cost, but I think youâ€™d be missing out. Itâ€™s recently been renovated, so the rooms are top notch â€“ big fluffy duvet, very comfy bed and nice B+O flat screen TV. The shower had a wonderful rain shower which was great too. If I was to have one negative it would have to be the size of the rooms â€“ I had a Superior Room, which is one step up from the smallest room and it was a bit on the small side, especially the bathroom. However, London is blessed with much smaller rooms than this and itâ€™s not as if they can make them any bigger! If you want a larger room youâ€™re going to need to pay for it. Staff were reasonably efficient â€“ front desk and porters were welcoming and friendly, a little bit slow to offer coffee at breakfast, but otherwise good. Location is fine too â€“ close to the tube, Buckingham Palace and the Parks. In summary, a very relaxing and nice hotel â€“ I wish I could stay there more often.
UR14314801	My wife and I wanted a weekend break, so I booked the room on my Priority Club points. I was welcomed with big hotel style (cold but efficient) and was told I had been up graded to a superior room, the room was good albeit a bit small, but plush. I did not spend a lot of time in the room; however, the range of TV channels was extensive. I did not use the restaurant, but I did have a drink in the bar, however, the cost was off the scale expensive, would I go back â€“ yes, great hotel from the visit I had.
UR12736338	I had a corporate trip booked by AMEX. The desk staff lost my reservation, then put me in another room, promised 3 times to correct the mishap, and then billed me personally. After a lengthy process, the hotel continued to demand that I pay personally. The service after stay was just as poor as the service during the stay. The desk staff was truly ignorant. The blood stains on my carpet did not thrill me either. Intercontinental's luxury status is so scattered. My condolences to future guests.
UR12658178	We stayed at the InterContinental Park Lane for one night with my husband and our 2 young children. The staff were friendly and welcoming, the children were given books and toys, concierge were very helpful and knowledgeble, overall, an excellent hotel.
UR12428309	We spend our 1st Year holidays at the hotel. It was our second time there and the bad was that we find the first time better.Good location, but something is missing to be a 5 star hotel....
UR12397305	My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our first stay at the hotel a couple of months ago and decided to stay there again this time around. The bad stuff: -Doormen stood and watched me carry my own luggage. No offer to help at all. No 'Good Morning' or 'Welcome to Intercontinental'. -When we were going out in the evening, there were no doormen at all and no taxis although we waited 15mins. We had to walk up the road to catch a taxi. -We had a drink at the bar with a couple of friends and no one served us for 20mins and by the time our drinks came, we were told that the bar was closed. Didn't tip the waitress for her lousy service and didn't receive my change! She conveniently pocketed it. -No bedroom slippers and it was a deluxe room. -Ordered breakfast to the room (too late to have breakfast downstairs) and the toast was BLACK. On both sides. Not brown, all black. Granola tasted like styrofoam and the rest of the food was just mediocre. I emailed the hotel management twice with my complains and still have yet to hear from them. It's been three weeks since! Don't think I will be staying here anytime soon. Not worth the money!
UR12247452	Myself and my fionsee stayed here for one night on NYE, although it was expensive, Â£203, then Â£245 inc tax, Id definately say this was a 5 star experience, upon arrival we were greeted by the Manager who was very chatty and helpful, the foyer was welcoming and check in was quick and simple, we were on the 6th floor,room 686, our room had a wonderful view, showing big ben and the london eye. (we should of stayed here to watch the fireworks as we were ushered behind a building and missed them completely - anyway thats another story :) ) all the mod cons, a plasma screen, volume in the bathroom, a powerful shower, the bed was soooooo comfortable and large, the room was silent, with lovely thickcurtainsI woke up and forgot where I was! We wandered down to breakfast in the morning which was a also a 5 star experiance, staff again couldnt do enough to help, offering to collect more orange juice even though its self service, the food was a fantastic quality and they even offer 2 different types of smoothys, yum! If a had to be pedantic, they forgot to bring our toast, but thats it! Great overall 5 star experiance, thank you Intercontinental!
UR11983561	Stayed here for one night in early December, while in London to see the Sound of Music and the Tutankhamun exhibition. The location near Hyde Park suited our travel plans, especially as it bucketed down with rain most of the time we were there, so the closeness to the tube was helpful. I'd booked online with Octopus Travel and became concerned at check-in (at around 5.30) as it was looking like they had no rooms. I mentioned we were going to see a show, and the receptionist said 'So you'll need somewhere to get changed then - I'll talk to our room allocator (not her words, but I can't remember the term she used!) to see if we can find you a room'. A room was eventually forthcoming, which was fine - clean, tidy and with all the amenities we expected, however we were near the lift lobby, and one of the lifts was squeaking, creaking and groaning all night when in use - when the hotel were advised of this on check-out, they simply said 'Thank you so much for letting us know' - not even an apology! Breakfast was included in our rate, and the food was very good, almost everything you could think of was available - but the service left much to be desired. We had to ask for tea, coffee and toast on several occasions, and no dishes were cleared from the table despite them piling up on one side, so much so that the waiter bringing milk (which hadn't been brought with the tea) struggled to find space for it, yet still ignored the pile of dishes! Overall a nice hotel, but the service needs improving....
UR11912926	This hotel situated right by Hyde Park is a great place to stay (especially this time of year with Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park!!) The location is great and the hotel itself is well...what you would expect for a five star! Some may say rooms are small. I beg to differ, they were actually a great size, as this is London and space it at a prime. I was more than satisfied by the space.The Staff were not snooty as they are in most hotel of this calibre and they were ready to help with absolutely anything at all. The breakfast is AMAZING!!!!! Go for the Full shebang and get the full English which included continental. It gets delivered to your room on a table (pulls out to full size!!!) with Italian Linen and enough food to keep you going for a long While!!!!! And so prompt I ordered for 9 and at 9 they knocked on the door! Impressed!Bathroom was good with Elemis products, smallish but as I said...Its London. Lovely massive tub! I would recommend for business people as its not a cosy family hotel. Its a chic London , upmarket hotel
UR11484052	Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Intercontinental. Its location is key, and the recent refurb was well done. We used Kayak and had a great rate for the area (but certainly not cheap), and Iâ€™d definitely stay there again. A pleasant surprise was Theo Randallâ€™s restaurant downstairs. We hadnâ€™t planned on dining there and were lucky to find a seat on a nearly fully booked Saturday night, but were very happy with our meal. The meal was pricey (160 quidâ€¦ about $360 US), but it showed up a celebrity chefâ€™s Knightsbridge restaurant. While this may have been a few menu choices, I was impressed overall. A negative to the hotel was the incredible price of room service and anything above an beyond our discounted room rate. While I know this is Mayfair, I had cheaper drinks at Nobu (9 drinks for 85 quid) on Berkeley Street than I did in our own room. We only ordered room service once because the prices were just too much to justify for the luxury of staying in. Pros: Location, Theo Randallâ€™s, Service was impeccable. Negative: Itâ€™s Mayfair, but wowâ€¦ $35 US for a small Pizza?
UR10815258	This hotel is very stylish and eveything looks brand spanking new following the recent renovation. It's a shame this hotel is in such a monstrosity of a building -- other ***** hotels definetely have a more romantic feell to them as you walk into the lobby. Quality of service was excellent. The hotel is located in a pretty good position with Picadilly, Mayfair and Oxford Street all within walking distance. It's just a shame about all the homeless people in the Hyde Park corner subway which you should probably avoid at night, if only for the smell (I suppose it helps you to keep it real as you're walking back to your luxury room). TIPS: 1) Instead of going to the bar in this hotel go to the top floor bar at the Park Lane hilton next door for what is one of the best views in London and very good cocktails too. 2) Request a exterior room-- we were stuck with a room on the inside of the building and had non-existent views other than the activities of other guests!
UR7926133	Had I known how great this hotel was beforehand, I would have stayed here my entire stay in London instead of changing hotels. Great service & great room.
UR7843420	My wife and I stayed here for one night in June '07. We had a one Bedroom Suite on the eighth floor and whilst it wasn't the largest suite around, it was certainly well fitted out. The Lounge had a working area with desk and chair, a sofa and easy chair and B&O TV. The Bedroom also had another B&O TV and Bose Wave Radio/CD. The Bathroom was a nice size and had a separate shower and bathtub. The Bedroom and Lounge both had terrific views over Hyde Park. Room service breakfast was fine. Everything was cooked as requested and presented to the usual IC high standards. Had drinks in the Lobby Lounge and service and quality were very good. The hotel has a much more modern feel now that it has been refurbished. The main entrance is much more grand than it once was. This makes for a great base whilst in London.
UR128312894	Stayed here in february. That time it was freezing in amsterdam, temperatures round -10 but my room was warm and clean, and bed was comfortable. Location is superb, right near the vondelpark and a 15 min stroll to the leidseplein. A big plus for me was they sold Duvel beer in the little bar at the reception.
UR126896338	As the Dutch philosopher Spinoza said; "All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare. " I've stayed at his hotel a couple of times and it is ok ... for Amsterdam standards. Each room is themed after a different Philosopher. The best room is probably Spinoza - here at least the internet works (in most rooms it doesn't and you have to go to reception to use wifi). The hotel and rooms are in the typical charming old style for Amsterdam with steep narrow staircases, tiny bathrooms, soft and saggy beds. It's clean but sparingly maintained.
UR123536705	Great Location - right off a park and in a very pretty neighborhood. The room itself was also nice, with direct access to an outdoor courtyard. The bathroom smelled a bit like mildew and the room itself was cold. I loved the theme and the decor was cute.
UR123041340	The room itself in pretty poor shape. A very amateurish mural on the wall, mismatched furniture, badly stained carpets, faded drapes, a dorm-room quality bed -- just basically in bad need of updating and refreshing all around. The wi-fi signal did not reach my room, which was a particular disappointment. On the plus side, the staff were extremely, extremely friendly and helpful. Super accommodating, lovely people. My room had a small but very clean and recently-renovated washroom with modern fixtures and great water pressure. The neighbourhood is lovely -- not super touristy, but lots of nice wandering nearby. Lots of great reasonably-priced restaurants, close by the park, right on the #1 tram line. If you're looking for somewhere just to basically crash inexpensively, this would suit. I wouldn't stay here if I planned to spend any serious time at the hotel itself. Lots of potential, but investment needed to make this into a better class of hotel.
UR121927816	I was staying here on business. Check in was very efficient and all the staff I met were friendly and helpful. I normally stay in rather bland 4 star chain hotels so it was nice to be staying somewhere with local character. The public areas were clean, cozy and nicely decorated. There is a lift to the upper floors if you don't feel brave enough to tackle the VERY steep spiral staircase. I would recommend not using the stairs if you have feet larger than a UK size 4 or have drunk any alcohol in the previous 24 hours! You will need 100% attention! You need to know that the rooms vary a lot in terms of size and quality - some are even in a separate building over the road. My room looked nothing like those you'll see on the Hotel website. The rooms on my floor were themed and decorated in what first struck me as a slightly hippy 1970s style. I wasn't too keen when I first saw my room but I have to admit that it grew on my during my stay. If you're a 'glass half full' type of person you'd say that the room has character. The room was a reasonable size with a very high ceiling. I had a view over the nice garden at the back, I think it would be a very good place to relax with a drink in the summer. The shower room / toilet looked like it had recently been modernised. The shower was very powerful and the water lovely and hot. As others have mentioned, the shower screen only covered about half of the shower enclosure which means that no matter how careful you are, the whole of the bathroom floor and the toilet gets wet which isn't ideal. The bed was a little tired but I got a reasonable nights sleep during my stay, partly helped by the very thick curtains that kept the room dark in the morning. The radiators in my room were easy to control and I could change the temperature in the room very quickly. There is free WiFi downstairs and some can get a signal on the second floor - I did which was a nice bonus. Breakfast was a reasonable mix of hot and cold food. At 15 euros though, you may prefer to take a stroll and find a cafe nearby. The hotel is in a quiet street in easy walking distance of local shops, a nice park and several museums and galleries. I walked to the Van Gogh museum one afternoon; took about 15 minutes. There's a tram stop (line 1) about 200m from the hotel. Great for getting back to the central station and some of the main shopping areas on route. Overall, nice stay. I'd be happy to stay there again.
UR121393715	Very old and dusty hotel. The pictures of the rooms are not representative of the hotel. We have visited 4 rooms after having asked to change the room. Need a total renovation: paintings, electricity, bathrooms pipes, bedsâ€¦Very expensive, not worth of it. Don't be surprise if your room is in the building in front of the main buidling also! Do not recommend this hotel.
UR119937241	I would rather stay at nice 3 star, than a poor 4 star. The good points of Hotel Filosoof. 1) rooms nicely decorated with a theme. You don't feel like you could be in any city in a big brand name hotel that doesn't really care about you: hence point 2) free wifi: 3) nice cotton sheets on bed. this can be overlooked. I can't stand polyester mix sheets; 4) The location is not super central, but it is convenient/pleasant.very near Tram no. 1 stop, the museum quarter and overlooks a park, the vondel park: 5) my room was quiet and overlooked trees and more trees. very tranquil for a hotel in a city like Amsterdam; 6) nice shower pressure; 7) the staff were great. The bad points: 1) the bathrooms are small, and have minimal shelf space to leave your toothbrush etc; 2) the hallways are small and the stairs steep and narrow. but that is the architecture of many Dutch buildings. Breakfast tip. go to Het vlaamsch broodhuis on eerste constatijn huygen straat. 5 min walk.
UR118958807	The hotel is very quaint,but the bed was terrible. The center of the bed was so indented that when you rolled over you experienced the sensation of falling. The shower had a tiny glass partition that did not protect the bathroom from experiencing the shower, too. The toilet and the floor were soaked despite every attempt to keep the water in the shower. Staff were hit or misss, some were great, while others were not so helpful.
UR118904981	We were in Amsterdam for 10 days; in Hotel Filosoof for 4 days. It was awful. Our other hotels were fabulous. Fodor's likes this hotel-- DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAY!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. WAY OVER PRICED. WAY OVER RATED. NOT NICE, RATHER TAWDRY CRAPPY SERVICE. PATHETIC BATHROOMS. THE OVERALL GENERAL MANAGER IS 22 YEARS OLD! YES, AND THE RUNNING OF THE HOTEL REFLECTS THIS FACT. I MET HER; SHE IS CLUELESS ABOUT LIFE AND THE NEEDS OF TRAVELERS, CHILDREN, PEOPLE, ETC. Other specifics: -It cost about $280 per night, was the most expensive hotel by twice on our trip, and it was the worst in every category -They wanted the entire bill paid in advance and were very unhelpful about this-- I refused on the spot, and they backed down -We booked a large single bed for 2 people, but they gave us two singles-- I had to refuse and decide to leave prior to their changing us to a larger double/queen size -The toilet (all toilets in Holland come out of the wall) was weak at the wall and moving around a bit-- we advised them but they did nothing. -The partition between the shower and the rest of the 3 foot by 6 foot bathroom-toilet area was only 18 inches or so. No shower curtain. Every time we showered, the entire bathroom was soaked. A definite inconvenience (this is an understatement) -The mattress was lumpy to the extreme, with humps in the mattress up to 4-6 inches in height, large trough like areas, and ridges that stuck up into one's back during sleep -Internet (wireless from the hotel) was very bad, and this is an understatement. It was mostly non-functional. -We were told the room was the largest, but it was tiny. They lied as I saw other rooms, all of which were slightly larger though still very small and cramped in general. -The staff was mixed-- some were very helpful; others rude, condescending and totally unhelpful. One staff member repeated the mantra "we are not responsible" about eight times until I begged her to at least give me an answer to a question. Exasperating -After I was sent (by the hotel manager) to the breakfast room to heat my coffee in the microwave, the head housekeeper came screaming at me across the breakfast room that I cant use the microwave-- in front of all the guests (about 10 of them, eating quietly). She later apologized, but it was rather humiliating.
UR118789316	This hotel is very nice. Although the decor is a little dated, it is spotlessly clean. The staff were very helpful at all times. We were up on the 3rd floor, a really steep stairs up to it but the lift was also an option. Our room was spacious & clean. Our en-suite bathroom was recently renovated & although small, perfectly adequate. We did not have breakfast (15 euros each - way too expensive!!) but there are cafe's & a supermarket nearby. Great location, near van gogh museum, beside vondelpark. Overall, highly recommended & I would definitely return
UR118636455	We arrived late one evening after booking some days earlier. Upon arrival we were asked to pay in advance, witch I find unusual, but we did anyway. Fortunately I kept the receipt, that would come in handy at checkout. The room price was ridiculous compared to the standard of the hotel. The rooms were badly maintained, everything was on the cheap in them, for instance the toilet paper that looked like something out of a movie about the great depression. The walls and celling stained, the carpet dirty, the windows badly maintained and the TV broken. Stains on the sheeting, dust in the corners, a worn down but big bathroom. The staff, friendly, but clueless. We felt like we were staying at the Fawlty Towers. When checking out we were first confronted with paying (again) for the stay. After some discussion and providing the receipt as evidence the receptionist, coincidentally the same that checked us in, accepted the fact that we actually had payed for the room. Then she claimed that we had not paid the city/tourist tax, witch we had. Again, after a discussion about this and having to provide an copy of the reservation I received by email, she finally accepted this as well. Unbelievable! I have no idea how to run a hotel, but I'm pretty sure I'd do better than the staff at the Filosoof. The only advice I can give others is to stay far, far away from this joke of an establishment. Amsterdam has plenty of decent hotels. This is barely a hotel, more a joke.
UR118036272	Really appreciate the idea and creativity of the owners. We liked the place from the first site. The rooms are really comfortable and attract attention. At the same time you feel very comfortable there. The location is great. We were totally satisfied.
UR117152200	The staff were pleasant, however: We had a reservation for about 3 months before we arrived to room 3 which was worn out. The walls looked like the roof was still leaking over us. There was not enough room to have a chair to sit in; there was a backless chair jammed between the wall and the lumpy bed which had torn and worn out upholstery. there was a small chair under the small desk on the wall at the foot of the bed, and I mean at the foot of the bed. In essence, there was no place to sit in the room and two bags could not be opened at the same time. The shower had no separation from the rest of the bathroom, causing a flood with every shower. In the evening it took about 5 minutes to get hot water. They supply no shampoo and only liquid soap. the towels are rough. They will rent bikes, which are essential due to the location from the center of the city, but the very kind attendant told us where we should really rent bikes, a 5 minute walk. We did use the hotel bikes one evening, which are dangerous in that they do not have bells, an essential and the brakes were poorly functioning. I walked around through the building: the stairways to the upper floors are a pain. The location is close to the canal stop and tram stop and easy to get to from the airport, and close to the park where the main museums are, but getting into the center of the city really requires biking, not a bad thing if you are comfortable biking through crowds and traffic. I would suggest a place closer into the canal area. It looks like the owners are having financial problems as the place is not well maintained.
UR115507403	I booked the room last minute based on the Lonely Planet review, then was surprised to see all the negative reviews. I think the LP review is much more accurate; it is charming and thoughtfully decorated. We stayed in the Aristotle cloud room, which was quite a bit more spacious than the higher priced hotel I stayed in during the business part of my stay in Amsterdam, and even had a small balcony. There is a lovely quiet garden off the back that is a nice way to unwind, and almost feel at home. The location is convenient to the city center, but not right in the noisy heart of it. The owners were friendly and eager to help. The bathroom was tiny but clean and newly renovated.
UR115185833	Stayed here and at a 3 star hotel in a different area of the city. When we booked a "cozy" room, I anticipated smaller than the 3 star but it was in fact much large and more enjoyable. We were in room 21 (clouds/Socrates) and it was one of the most thoughtfully decorated rooms I've seen, plus we had a nice little porch. That bathroom is very small, but facilities are upgraded and space is used wisely. Location was great, walking distance to beautiful park, numerous stores/restaurants, and tram stops. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, even booking our tours. One thing i wish was better was the internet consistency. It would go in and out and at times. Otherwise, this hotel was enjoyable and would recommend for someone who doesn't mind a smaller room with more character.
UR113566900	We stayed 3 night stay at the Hotel de Filosoof and found it manageable but agree with other reviews here that it was a bit run down and probably not the best value for the cost. Reception staff were friendly and on arrival we were given an â€˜aquaâ€™ themed room. We were lucky in that the lift did go to this floor as we didnâ€™t bring our abseiling gear for the staircase :-) The room, bathroom and shower were on the small side, but we found it to be enough for our needs and it was cleaned to a reasonable standard each day. I did find the bed a little on the hard side, but it was manageable. The furnishings were old and a bit quirky. Internet both wifi and a desktop PC was provided from the ground level rooms and was free and of a reasonable speed. Breakfast was 15 euro but a good selection of cereals, pastries and cold meats and breads as well as tea, coffee and juice. Cheaper breakfasts were easy to find just down the road as well. What we really enjoyed about this hotel was its location. It was right next to Vondelpark so it was nice and quiet, and we enjoyed going for walks through it. It was also a 10 minute walk through the park to nearby bars and restaurants. Also nearby were the GVB trains and the hop on hop off canal boats which get you to nearby tourist attractions and also central Amsterdam. If we were to return to Amsterdam, we would head stay in the location as its quiet and semi central, but stay at another hotel that is a bit more comfortable.
UR111981348	The concept of the hotel is to offer differently furnished rooms. Each room has its theme. I find this interesting. We stayed both in "Lady(ies) Sonoma" & "Confucius" rooms. However, "Lady(ies) Sonoma" suite is on the last floor of a building with very steep staircase. No lift. The staircase is so steep you wouldn't know how to climb up with your suitcase. When going down I held to both rails. The bathroom in this room is spacious but lacks sink, so you would brush your teeth in the kitchen corner. The kitchen corner is equipped with tea and coffee facilities. "Confucius" was smaller with no coffee and tea facilities, and there was a lift in this building. The people in the hotel were ice cold polite. I guess apart from the stairs of this hotel, there was nothing really wrong but the "aftertaste" of the experience isn't great either. The location is OK, just 2 tram stops away from the crowded city centre, and there's a nice park just few meters away. The prices, compared to other hotels we've seen were better, just the breakfast is somewhat expensive. The free internet is only in the lobby.
UR111571298	I stayed in Amsterdam over the week end and wanted to find a charm full and affordable hotel. I was somehow disappointed as yes this hotel is in a typical Amsterdam old house, in a lovely area but the rooms are average. My bathroom was ridiculous small and SO SMELLY ! Staff was ok. Breakfast was very expensive for what I got. The location is great, walking distance from this lovely park and convenient tram . I recommend breakfast or lunch at the cafÃ© of the Film Museum located in the park; it is a charm full place.
UR110187818	Well, in contrast to other reviews, I will say that the room was clean. It was cozy, but this is Europe after all. That being said, the bathroom bordered on ridiculous, with a sink that was smaller that that found in a train and a shower that had no curtain or door, thus flooding the bathroom every time I took a shower. Worse was the bed, which was akin to sleeping in a slumping hammock. And, paper thin walls/ceilings meant that every drunken guest returning at 1 a.m. woke up everybody. Just awful. The breakfast was very good and the staff friendly. But, if you can't sleep it's pretty difficult to then enjoy a day of seeing the city. So... never again.
UR107449145	Very friendly staff but the hotel is a dump. Our room was dirty and tired, bedside lamps not working etc. Furnishings were like junk shop pick ups...very psychophrenic in style however that would have been OK if everything was so run down and dirty. We complained about the dirty in the room and the next day it was cleaned...was OK but not of the standard that I would expect for the cost. The reception area is also minging. Even the beds are very uncomfortable. Certainly wouldn't stay here again!
UR106610208	I found it difficult to find a hotel in Amsterdam to accomodate our family (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 11) with either a family room or interconnecting rooms for the dates of our stay. However, when reading the reviews of this hotel I thought it may be OK. Well it wasn't. Worn and torn carpets as you enter, grungy, cluttered reception area with furniture i didn't want to sit on. As our room wasnt ready we went into the small garden which was rank with either cats' marking their territory or foliage - didn't know which but it smelt terrible. Room was in the basement at eye level with the said garden and below street level. Beds terribly uncomfortable and the so-called individual designed decor a euphemism for cheap finds at junk shops. Keep had to going to reception for towels as they never replaced sufficient for our family. As the bathroom fan didn't work there was no way that they could have dried and I wanted clean towels every day. Bugs on the bathroom window sill were never cleaned during our entire stay. I am amazed by the reviews that have previously been written. Perhaps we were unlucky being in the basement but the overall feel of the place is really grubby and I don't have anything good to say about this place other than it had a lift which helped with carrying out luggage. We never ate breakfast at this hotel - I didn't want to risk it - and found a very nice local cafe close by where the owner was pleasant and the food good. From a location perspective - close to the Park which meant I was able to go for a run one night - but a little bit out of the main areas of Amsterdam centre. I will never recommend nor stay here again.
UR99545068	Stayed in this hotel to see the city and art museums of Amsterdam for which purpose it was ideal. The staff were friendly and welcoming, bar area and other common areas relaxing after sightseeing. Our room was at the top partly in the roof so probably not the best, no views, but served its purpose for weekend break. We walked through the nearby park to the museums and tram stop around the corner to Central Station and city.
UR97321259	The room we had was very well decorated, the comfort of the, bathroom and bed were superb and the atmosphere made me feel at home. In addition to this the staff were very friendly and helpful and the central location was great.
UR96847560	I spent the weekend with friends in this hotel near the Vondelpark. The staff was great, service while checking in was real good. The rooms where perfect with nice beds and bathrooms!
UR96723965	We had a great time in this hotel in a feal amsterdam atmosphere (close to Vondelpark). We had beautiful weather and opened the characterisitc windows to enjoy the sounds of the city. The kingsize bed was perfect and the badroom was beautiful and clean. I would recommend this Hotel to everyone who wants to taste he real Amsterdam Life.
UR96556606	My husband and i stayed at the Hotel Filosoof for a weekend whilst visiting Amsterdam and had a FANTASTIC stay! whilst situated a little distance from the city centre, it is still easily within walking distance, and a pleasant walk at that. The staff were all very friendly and helpful offering to book tours, restaurants, taxi's etc for us and always enquired about our day/evening when we returned to the hotel at night. The breakfast buffet was delightful, with a great selections of breads, fruits, spreads, cheeses, hams. A great continental breakfast that could beat many other "good" hotels (and certainly filled our stomachs for the day ahead.) The general decor of the hotel was amazing and we felt like we were stepping into different eras and cultures with each step we took. Our room was very comfortable overall and the bed was one of the best beds i have slept in at a hotel in a long time, we visited in winter and although it was cold and snowy outside, our room certainly kept us warm and cosy! What was great also, is that this hotel is supporting a Dutch charity that is working overseas in Africa so at the end of my stay i had the opportunity to donate a few euros to a good cause! Thank you for making my stay so pleasurable. I will definitely be staying in another Sandton hotel.
UR88818498	Stayed here for 9 nights for over $100 a night, cheapest hotel i could find that wasn't a dump, so I thought while booking it. The service while checking in was descent , no type of extra effort from staff to make me feel comfertable. My room wasn't ready yet so I was told to leave my bags and relax ! no apology or anything . I guess it was my fault for coming an hour early. There was an Asian lady who worked working the breakfast buffet who was more concerned about my room number instead of seating me ! I guess she assumed I was trying to sneak a free breakfast out of the deal , , yea bcuz thats what I like to do , trave half way around the world , book a hotel for over $100 a night and trick my way into a free breakfast ! ! ! I didn't like her customer service skills need less to say . Overall The room was too smal for its price and there's no staff downstars past midnight. so If you need anything past that you're on your own. The location was ok if you don't mind riding the train for a few Euros to the city center. I wouldn't stay here again !
UR85156339	We have been in room 33, "balkan" style! What an old fashioned ugly simple room. The bathroom is for dwarfs. See also the already posted pictures with the mirror, TV and beige door. This is a shame Sandton!
UR83830694	When booking the hotel, my boyfriend and I were drawn to the modern well-presented rooms as depicted in their publicity photos. Even though we knew each room had a different "theme", we expected slight variances in interior decor but the overall impression would reflect the photos on their website - relaxed, comfortable & warm. We were wrong. Based on our experience, Room 30 was themed "Guilliver's Travels" - a room fit for six inch Lilliputians. The colonial features and cosiness weren't charming. Instead, it was a history lesson in how the the lower class lived in the 18th century. The sloping attic roof extended into the shower recess which meant showering on your knees but even that was a problem since the recess was literally 2 feet wide. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed in our room and the nail in the coffin was the beeping alarm clock hidden under our bed at 7:30 in the morning! Funny in hindsight. Not so funny at the time, As we had another two nights in Amsterdam, we kindly asked the front desk if we could switch rooms. She was extremely considerate and showed us other rooms that were available. She also organised for our luggage to be placed into our new room (Room 4) which was basic but twice the size of Room 30, clean and reasonably comfortable. Unfortunately, they forgot to give us towels so the attention to detail is slightly lacking at this hotel. Taxis are expensive in Amsterdam, particularly because of the one-way streets and canals in the central area. So if you are not willing to walk or learn the tram system, I would not recommend staying at the hotel. A taxi fare from Dam Square to the hotel is around 15 euro one-way. Getting to the hotel from the airport was very easy. A taxi was 38-40 euros. Otherwise, you can catch the train to Central station for 3.60 euros and then a cab for an additional 20 euros. Would I stay again? Probably not. We paid over 100 euro/night for a cosy room. I'd spend the extra 20 euros/night at another hotel to be honest.
UR81039960	We made the mistake of trusting an article in the Guardian newspaper about this hotel rating it as a great place to stay in Amsterdam. Wrong. On arrival, we moved rooms as both the telephone and hairdryer didn't work and there were no towels. Our new room (and the rest of the hotel) would have been very beautiful in it's day, but was in desperate need of a makeover - chipped paintwork and very old beds that felt as though they were filled with sand. Our TV remote control and some of the lights didn't work. The room felt cold and damp and we were unable to regulate the heating. We unable to connect to the wifi in our room and had to leave it to cross the street (to the main reception) and sit on their out-moded PC in a freezing room to access our emails. The hotel doesn't provide room service and as there are no tea/coffee making facilities in any of the rooms(!), you're forced once again, to pull on your shoes, leave your room, cross the street (where the main reception is) just to have refreshments. Our sleep was interrupted throughout the night by the slamming entrance door and footsteps along the uncarpeted hall and stairs. I really don't know how they can justify charging such prices on what felt like a backpacker's hostel. At least the breakfast was good.
UR78329284	I have travelled a fair bit and stayed in hotels, bed and breakfasts etc. Also, It takes quite a bit for me to feel aggrieved. Hotel de Filosoof is expensive for what it is and poor value. The situation of the hotel is great, on the borders of Vondelpark but that is where the good bits stop. The decor has definitely gone from Shabbychic to just plain Shabby. I had a single room which was very small, but the bed! I'm no expert on this, but I suspect you get wider beds in prison. There were a couple of occasions during the night when I nearly feel out. And in case you are wondering, no I am not a large person. On the day I was due to go to a friends' wedding, I did not have any hot water in my room. I reported this in the morning and it was still not fixed by the afternoon. I had the joy of washing my hair in cold water - and spraying myself with lots of perfume! The situation over breakfast is really clever. I had a variety of confirmations, some which indicated breakfast was included, others did not. When I checked in, it was very carefully pointed out to me the times for breakfast - but not that breakfast was not included. 15 euros it cost me for bread and cheese! The last time I paid this much for a breakfast was in a top London hotel which was a full cooked breakfast including smoked salmon. My fault for not checking, but I feel I was led to believe that breakfast was included. Not of course that breakfast was a joyous occasion, the first morning the cleaning staff were vacuuming, which was accompanied by the housekeeper shouting at them - not to stop, you understand, but to continue! The second morning, myself and another woman were sat in a draught as no one could shut the window. And the window in my room developed an alarming leak. Filosoof charges as if it is a top hotel - and it isn't. I have stayed in bed and breakfasts at seaside towns in England at the height of the season, and have enjoyed much better facilities. For less money. It's a poor joke I know but I think Filosoof expects you to be philosophical about their standards.
UR78027920	The hotel looked so much better on the internet! Very friendly staff at the reception and bar though. On arrival we had no towels in the rooms (we had booked 2 rooms) we got them later that day around 5pm. The next morning we all had to take ice cold showers because they had problems with the heating system, it was fixed that night. No toilet paper was refilled, the staff serving breakfast: extremely grumpy! The rooms were very small and no coffee/tea maker, so the next morning at 7:35 A.M, I went to the breakfast lounge for coffee........there was none made yet! And last but not least we hardly could get on the internet :-(
UR65788475	A lovely and charming hotel with a special character. It's located right next to the Vondelpark in an amazing quiet and nice neighborhood.
UR65501416	It advertised themed philosopher rooms but I think that is only for the main building. They also own two buildings across the street which is where I was put. Felt like going into my own house which could be nice but no reception or staff right there. They are just across the street. not a big deal, but when I am paying a fair amount of money for a hotel, I want to feel like I am in a hotel. Also, I was downstairs with half windows on top to the street. That happened to me the last time I was in Amsterdam at a different hotel. So normal there, I guess. I booked just the week before so maybe I was lucky just to get a room. Right by the Vondelpark and the street along the park is beautiful. Had breakfast one morning in Cafe Vertigo in Vondelpark and was a lovely spot. Food only OK but cheap for such a prime location.
UR62285616	Last week me and my friend stayed in hotel de Filosoof. We really had a good time! The room was nice, not really big, but big enough for the 2 of us, and clean. I really like the "philosopher" theme. The staff was really friendly; they showed us all the good places to visit and eat and they helped us arranging a trip to "keukenhof". The museumsqaure and shopping areas are only 5 minutes away (by bike) and there is a tramstop around the corner. I would really go back to this hotel :)
UR61296171	Bit scruffy old hotel, damp rooms, old bathroom with insects, worn down, not worth the money at all, although the location is quite good, tv platform was there but no TV,
UR60155273	A charming hotel, that does not give you the impression of belonging to a big chain (as it actually does). The room we got was cosy decorated but bad kept. The hose for the shower and one lamp did not work. With no fridge, no water boiler and a very small tv it was all pretty basic. But the bed was very comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast in the hotel was miserable, with a very limited selection and poor quality of what was served. Apparently they do not have a cook for breakfasts, but just one overworked person who had to keep up, and who did not manage to stay polite. No bacon, no sausages, no scrambled or fried eggs (but baked beans from a can). All products seem to be bought ready made - juice of concentrate, fruits from a can and some old supermarket croissants. The hotel has a nice little garden and a cosy reading room facing the garden. Very good location in Amsterdam, near to the Vondelpark and major museums.
UR59110728	Rooms could definitely do with a makeover. We stayed in a 'suite', room 134. Very big and could be very nice but the decor and overall quality is poor. Breakfast is quite an experience...the staff are rude and don't seem to be able to cope! On Saturday things seemed to work fine, by Sunday the same woman seemed to be close to some kind of nervous breakdown. when asked if there were any more glasses for the juice, she started screaming (and yes I do mean she really did shout) that there were no more glasses and that it was 'rush hour' apparently. There was also no orange juice, plates, bread and the breakfast 'service' had another 1.5 hours to run!! If you must stay here, take breakfast elsewhere.
UR55019809	I booked this hotel ages ago as I like places that have differently furnished rooms and are not slick and dull and chainy. The pictures looked smashing. Then I saw all the bad reviews on here and got a bit concerned as I was taking my boyfriend for his birthday and didn't want it to be manky. I should not have been concerned. The room was a deluxe double. I got three nights for the price of two so it was 270 euros, which is pretty good for Amsterdam. The room was a good size, with a massive kingsize bed, super comfy mattress and pillows. We didn't have a wetroom, which so many people have (I think unfairly) complained about. Had a small bathroom with a little bath and a really good shower. Room was decorated really nicely with all reds and golds and silvers. The furniture was nice and junkshoppy, cool lamps and a chest. It was very cold when we got in it, but heated up quickly with the radiators on. Staff were nice, communal areas and the building lovely. We had a nosey into some other rooms, and the some were much smaller, but they are advertised as such! And as for being far out of town - ba! So easy to get there from the airport. Short train ride to Lelylaan, short tram ride to a stop 2 minutes walk in the snow! Right next to the park and close to all the museums. On Overtoom, the road perpendicular to the road the hotel is on has so many really nice bars, restaurants and cafes on it. And a nice walk into town. Amsterdam is so pretty it is good to have a wander around. We got the tram back from Central Station once when it was raining and it took 10 minutes in traffic. Breakfast is a bit pricey, but food is generally in Amsterdam and it was lovely with a great selection. I would recommend it!
UR52949054	We were impressed with the Hotel itself but were given bad directions by others regarding its location that by the time we arrived (having lugged our bags from the Train Station, in snow, and slush and ice.... In Amsterdam, the pedestrians are the lowest animal on the food chain, and no one shovels the sidewalks, In fact, no one owns shovels!!!) we were utterly exhausted. Somehow, when we made reservations at the suggestion of a friend, we thought we'd be in Central Amsterdam, On the Contrary, we were several stops on the Tram outside the Central District. The rooms are small, and the shower's lack of a door made it's use a very wet experience for the entire bathroom. The sink is so small you can only wash one hand at a time and forget brushing your teeth in the sink, you have to use the shower. The Staff is great , and the breakfast is very nice, and the service is exceptional, Price is high for the location and the size, but then everything in Amsterdam is pricey, except the free tour. If I were to return to Amsterdam, I'd probably seek accommodations in a Hostel, rather than suffer the tram ride and the high price. Filosoof is great for the experience, and the quiet location and the good food if you don't mind the Tram ride or the walk.
UR50870101	Apparently the hotel's forniture looked nice and nifty, but once arrived in our room things changed. The room was defenitley too small and not really comfortable. Besides you have to pay for breakfast. I don't think I would come back there.
UR50849302	The receptionist is nice.Somehow we were arranged to live in the basement. No lift. Its near a park. We walked through the park to go to visit Van Gogh Museum.
UR49289743	We arrived right after they got robbed and our personal credit card information was stoel. When they told us about it they "offered" us drinks and then charged us...then when we went to pay for our visit in cash the manager told us we were inconveniencing her...what great customer service...never in my life have I heard that getting case was inconvenient...anyways it was not the best stay to say the least.
UR46003145	Had stayed in this hotel 6 years ago, before it was bought by Sandton Hotels, and had very good memories. I actually remembered it as a boutique theme hotel, with nice atmosphere. This is why it was again our choice, even though it is not really central and it is quite expensive. However, it was so bad, we had to pack our things and leave after the first night. We had originally booked a DELUXE room. We were given a room which was of good size. However, the bathroom was tiny and did not have either shower cabin or bath tub; there was just a shower pluged on the wall, sending the water directly to the floor. A plastic curtain separated the "shower" from the toilet. The bathroom was so small, that taking a shower would make it a lagoon. We asked for a room with a proper bathroom. They showed us various rooms -no wonder why there were so many vacancies- and we ended up in a standard room (EROS room). Again the bathroom was too small, and you could smell the mould, but at least it was properly equiped. In the room, the wall paper was filthy and so was carpet, under which you could feel the holes on the wooden floor. The window did not close properly -we asked for someone to fix it but they didn't. The towels were really old, one of them even had holes on it!! Even the toilet paper is the cheapest (hence roughest) you can get. Yes, the staff is polite and helpful, the internet is free, the public areas are charming and the breakfast is what you would expect from a 3* hotel, but it is the room you get to sleep in at the end of the day. I was shocked and embarassed, because I had recommended this hotel to the friend I was travelling with. It was like visiting a different hotel. I wonder, would it cost a lot replace the towels? Would it cost a lot to install a proper shower in the bathrooms? Do they think that the philosophical quotes and the drawings on the walls would compensate for the overall decay?
UR41428952	I wish everyone could stay at the Hotel de Filosoof while in Amsterdam. Between the airport and the hotel I had two bad falls. I arrived crying, bleeding, and I could not see because my glasses were damaged. I was met with concern and guided to a room where I was helped to clean-up and Irma settled me with a bracing pot of tea. Room 15 helped my healing. It is so soothing. The bath has a large deep tub with a shower. The view is through two large windows that open over the garden, a sea of green treetops with birds flying by, and a majestic church spire over all. The next day Gaime located a nearby optician on the street. (Most are in malls, but I could not see to walk.) He escorted me to the optician where my glasses were fixed sufficiently that I could see again. Neither taxi driver, optician, or my escort would accept payment. I was humbled by their care. After returning to the hotel, since I had not eaten real food since leaving home, Gaime created an artful tray of meat, cheese, fruit, and juice. With the help of the staff, I was able to see the Old Masters' paintings that I had come to Amsterdam to see. Marleen ordered taxis and found me lovely corners to relax and drink tea. And so, you see, I wish everyone could stay at the Hotel de Filosoof when in Amsterdam. -- Barbara.
UR41144590	Lovely artistic hotel located about 10 minutes tram ride to Centraal station. Very interesting decor, beautiful common areas, lovely garden. Single room was tiny and the elevator small. corridors very narrow and quite a few steps to reach the recetion - if you have a heavy suitcase and a long journey behind you it can be tricky. the staff were very friendly. location is good, you can pick up a tram about 5 minutes from the hotel to the city centre or walk about 30 minutes to the centre.
UR39165916	Hotel de Filosoof is in a great quiet area away from tourists and traffic noise but it is still very conveniently located close to the park, the museums, and just a short tram ride away from the centre of it all. The room was Euro-small but clean, convenient and totally fine for a single traveler. I don't know if I would recommend for two people to stay unless you are used to small living quarters. The staff were always very friendly, there are lots of great sitting areas, including a garden, and lots of books. The bed was not the nicest but it was certainly comfortable and clean. Each room is decorated in an eccentric fashion so if you want your usual Hilton sterility, don't stay here.
UR27687697	We have just returned (April 09) from a three night stay at the Hotel de Filosoof, Amsterdam. Whilst we appreciated the quirky ideas put into the room, it felt more like an an after thought than the basis for the design of the hotel. We stayed in a cosy room, which was a small, basic, 'no frills' room with a tiny shower room with toilet. This room is shown on the internet with the french windows opening up into a lovely garden; in reality it smelt damp due to the location being in the cellar and the garden was in need of a gardener. When we first arrived, the room was also very cold, but this improved when we turned the heating up to full blast. The location of the hotel was in a quiet area about a 10 min walk to one of the main eating and shopping areas, we found this a positive aspect of the hotel as it was nice to be outside of the 'craziness' of Amsterdam city centre and you could stroll back via the lovely Vondel Park. Also, the area is well serviced for trams and is close to the museum district. However, our room was not in the same building as the main hotel, since it was in a separate house across the road. The basic-ness of the room's facilities meant we were quite isolated as we had no fridge, or communal area where we could see other people, (also, not that we went to watch TV, but the one in our room was very old and a bit dodgy) and, there was no security. As we were in a converted residential house it would have been quite easy to break into the room through the back garden and french windows (the safe, which was in the room, did not work). Best advice would be to try and stay in the main building. On the positive side, the staff were quite friendly, we enjoyed our time in the city and, if you happen to be a philosopher, the snippets of specific ideas they put together do have their charm and get one thinking!
UR27508425	our room was very small. i'm used to small hotel rooms but this was nuts. the bathroom TINY and very poorly designed. the toilet didn't work in our room and there was someone else's stuff in it! the tv also didn't work. they gave us a new room across the hall. everything in working order but again the room was too small and the bathroom was poorly designed (a shelf that goes into the shower, so it gets water everywhere!). walls are thin, i could hear people talking and walking up and down the stairs. the hotel isn't really that close to anything. the only positive thing i have to say is that the front desk girl was very nice. unfortunately that is not enough to make us stay there again.
UR25102566	This hotel is tucked away by Vondel Park...which to some is better than staying in a loud slum right in the heart of Amsterdam. Oddly enough, like many said we did not have towels, but they brought them to us. The service was a bit unfriendly but not unaccomadating. You have to ride a tram to visit any attractions like Leidseplein. Overall, great if you don't mind walking quite a bit in order to come "home: to peace & quiet.
UR22006195	We stayed in this hotel after having been there a few years ago. It has most definitely gone downhill. The staff were as helpful and friendly as on our previous stay and I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat there. 15Euro is a bit much just for breakfast! However after having stayed in the annexe last visit I expected a bit more pleasant surroundings in the main building this trip - but was I disappointed! The bed was vaguely comfy, but the bedding looked decidedly like a dead dog! After 4 nights I looked like a dot-to-dot book I'd been bitten so badly by SOMETHING! The paint was hanging from the ceiling, we had to ask for towels every night and how many hotels don't have at least a kettle in your room. All in all a big disappointment (and not a cheap one a that) and not somewhere we'll go back to.
UR21787983	The hotel is nicely located in a quiet side street off Overtoom, close to tram stops and Vondelpark, and walkable to the city centre - this is the upside. Our room was in an annexe, and was very tired and dingy. I accept the hotel is intended to be characterful and quirky, however our room was simply in need of a major makeover. It was only superfically clean, and was also cold and draughty. The bathroom was tiny, with a dribbly shower. Building work was going on next door, and with Dutch builders starting at 7 am, there wasn't much opportunity for a lie in. Whilst this is only temporary, the hotel didn't handle it very well from a service point of view. Breakfast was also very average - I haven't seen tinned fruit in hotels since the 1970s.
UR20876425	This was my first stay in Amsterdam since my whippersnapper days when i would have slept anywhere. Now i,m looking for comfort, good service and value for money. The Hotel de Filosoof fits all these categories and i would recommend it unrservedly
UR20317609	Second time staying here and no particular criticisms of hotel other than expensive - ended up more than we'd expected - maybe down to us. The location is excellent - minutes from the Vondelpark and tram to Central Station a few meters away. On second occasion we were in the annex. OK but we didn't know til we got there. Breakfast is good and plentiful. Would recommend for a first time visitor but we'll explore and experiment with other hotels next time.
UR20227397	Made booking with online internet travel group reservation site. Arrived at Filosoof hotel, but then I realised I made wrong booking October 12-14, instead of September 12-14. The Hotel was unfortunately full, and so were a lot of hotels in Amserdam, because of the a big number of visitors attending the IBC conference. The Hotel manager was very helpful to find us a nice hotel, call the hotel, arrange the room price for a 2 night stay, and offer us a drink. What a treat !!!!! Thank you very much for your service and so pity we could not stay in your hotel, that looks very nice, and well located and quiet area.
UR18604700	My Girlfriend and I went for a long weekend in Amsterdam and the Hotel de Filosoof turned out to be a lovely hotel in a decent location. My girlfriend is Dutch so managed to get a special deal from a dutch website, which meant we got a room upgrade and breakfast for only 20 euros extra each. With breakfast at 15 euros this was a good deal and I suspect made a big difference in our stay. From reading the other reviews it seemed some of the rooms are rather small, ours however was a big spacious room with everything you'd expect from a hotel (tv, toiletries, towels etc). It was also very clean so we had no complaints with the room at all. The towels were replaced both days we were there and the bed was remade both times as well....something i was not expecting from reading some of the previous reviews. The breakfast is a good standard continental breakfast with plenty of choice and lots on offer! We took our coffee out into the back garden which was a lovely quiet space that takes you away from the city. As for the location; its right on a tram stop which takes 10 minutes to get to the city centre. Although we often walked which took about 30 minutes from the city centre but only about 15 minutes from the lively Leidseplein which has a number of bars and restaurants. It seems it is difficult to find mid range decent hotels in Amsterdam. Those that are dirt cheap often have terrible reviews whilst the hotels with solely excellent reviews are often extremely expensive. I shopped around for a long time and eventually realised most hotels have mixed reviews so gambled on this one. This paid of as the Hotel de Filosoof was a lovely hotel at a very reasonable price.
UR17293141	The Hotel de Filosoof and I got off to a bad start weeks before I arrived. I was informed via email that my credit card information (which had been printed out erroneously and left unattended presumably) had been snatched by opportunistic bandits from the reception slash bar area. For the inconvenience of having to cancel my card 'Jaime' offered me free breakfasts during my stay. Fair enough. However, on check-in, the attendant had no record of this. She informed me instead that my room had been upgraded. Now we're talking! Room 30, the 'Nietzsche' room, is roughly 9 by 9 feet less an obtrusive closet housing a lonely coat hanger, two 30 degree acutely angled exterior walls and the requisite interior attic beams. The TV, without remote and suspended mere inches below ceiling height, simply doesn't work. Neither does the safe. Nor is there a clock. The bedspread and accent pillows are faded and stained. Carelessly painted and in need of a thorough de-dingifying, the only references to philosophy or philosophers are an amateurish collage in a small frame and four Italian paperbacks nestled next to a Dutch bible on a crooked shelf hanging on the smudgy wall. The bathroom is so tiny I can simultaneously flush the toilet, toss a used razor blade into the Lilliputian garbage can (then half-full) and style my hair in the mirror while hunched under the chin-height drizzle of alternating tepid and scalding water... Upgraded from what? Would they have me believe that the (only slightly) smaller room down the hall shown on the map on the back of the door is named after the righteous Dutch philosopher 'Techniek'? And all the while (this is day three here under Nietzsche's furrowed brow and ridiculous moustache) the mysterious enigma that is Jaime is nowhere to be found, no longer answers my pleas for the promised orange juice and cereal on the house, and no one knows when he'll be back. Maybe he's vacationing elsewhere, in another room, at another hotel. I know I wish I was!
UR13376600	I went to Amstardam to run the marathon in October. The location of the hotel was great to get the strating line in the morning by bike. I was expecting better because I had read many good comments about the hotel, we got the japanese one which was in another building. Breakfast was good, the bedroom just ok. I found a little bit expensive for the bedroom we had to be honest. Free internet access was great.
UR12984550	We had booked, was confirmed by e-mail/ telephone. Prices of rooms were suddently higher. two weeks before arrival the confirmation was cancelled. What a service...........
UR12754630	As it was our first time in Amsterdam, we were not quite interested in booking a fancy hotel. De Filosoof seemed to be a good idea although its price seemed a little bit high. However, as all hotels in Amsterdam didn't seem to be any cheaper, we thought we would give it a shot! Location was nice, very close to a tram stop, the area very neat as the hotel was located close to Vondel Park and only a few minutes walk from Van Gogh's and Rijks Museum. The breakfast room as well as the hall were cozy and quiet, you could enjoy your breakfast or coffee while reading or having a nice chat. Rooms were tidied up on a daily basis, they were warm and quiet. Breakfast was satisfactory, service ok, staff quite friendly. However, our room was so small that we could bearly move without bumping into each other. I presume there are some bigger rooms, but a price of 115 Euros (inluding taxes) for such a small room was a little bit disappointing!
UR11215556	We have stayed at this hotel in October 07 between the dates of 18th-21st. It was our first travel to Amsterdam,we have been told this is a city center hotel and I read the reviews that the rooms are themed by the famous filosoofs, I liked the idea. We arrived the hotel which is on a quiet nice neigbourhood, couldn't check in because it was early, left the bags, we spotted that there's a tram station 5 min away and you need to take tram to go to the city center which is almost 10 min. away. We have stayed at the other building ( not the main) accross the street, it was Goethe room, room was ok but I can't not say it was unique and special, I thought it was a little dull. The main building is a little bit old too, the staff was ok but the breakfast was very bad.I also read the bathroom was very small which is very true. The location is good if you like to take long walks in nature because the Vogelpark is just like next door. Next time I am sure I will stay in other hotel close to the center, it saves more time and energy.
UR10032033	we stayed in room 114 which was across the road from the main hotel building! we had the room on the first floor which had (we thought) a huge wide double bed, but on closer inspection we realised it was two single beds pushed together and the bedding was for two single beds! this made snuggling up at nite difficult, but it meant we were far enough away from each other to not hear the snoring! breakfast was average, but the room was huge and it had a bath as well as the shower!! ideal location for hopping on and off the trams or going for a walk in the park. we didnt have any problems walking back to the hotel late at night!! we'd go there again, but next time i want hoisted in with those hooks they use for furniture, instead of trying to negotiate the stairs ( i aint a mountain climber) wendi and alex from scotland
UR8611538	The hotel description struck us as quirky and interesting, and the price was OK so we booked it for a 2-night stay. It was supposed to be in a nice neighbourhood, but in February, the neighbourhood struck me as a little drab and deserted at night, so I wouldn't recommend walking back there from the heart of town if it's too late. Luckily, the hotel is fairly near a tram stop, so it's not too difficult to get here. It's also next to the Vondelpark, and there are a few restaurants within walking distance, although few of them actually look very compelling. The staff at reception were friendly and pleasant, so we have no complaints there. We were given a room on a floor that had been recently refurbished, so the smell of paint pervaded everywhere. Even worse, they had used paint or glue in our bathroom, and the smell was extremely strong in the room, which was of a modest size. But we were told to expect that from hotels in Amsterdam, so that wasn't the biggest problem. However, we spent the first night freezing, because a gap had been left in the window overhead. Shutting the window however, meant that the strong paint smell from the bathroom was suffocating. We spent 2 nights here, and the first night I couldn't sleep ebcause of the cold, and the second night, I didn't sleep because of the nauseating smell of paint! We had no idea what philosopher our room was meant to represent - there was a flaming, golden tulip painted on the wall, and there was a homey, eccentric feel to the decor. The bathroom was so small that if you sat on the toilet, you would bump your knees on the sink. And it was impossible to use the shower without the water going all over the floor. The bathroom was as small as a wardobe, and could best be described merely as 'functional'. No problems with the cleanliness, and as I remember, the breakfast spread was also quite acceptable. It was an interesting stay, because it was really the quirkiest hotel I've ever stayed in, but I am in no rush to repeat the experience. I probably won't be booking this hotel on my next trip to Amsterdam as there might well be better offerings closer to the heart of the city.
UR8400050	I stayed at the Hotel de Filosoof in August 2007. As the trip to Amsterdam was a birthday present for my brother everything had to be perfect. And it was! We had a three bed room and a double room and both were really nice and big. The bathrooms were quite small, but big enough for 2 people. When we opened the window we could hear the noise from the big street in the near of the hotel (Overtoom), but when you close the windows, it is completely quite. The next tram stop (tram 1) is at 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The breakfast was very good (ham, cheese, eggs, jam, fruits, various sorts of bread). And the best: if you want you can have your breakfast in the wonderful small garden! Attention: you have to pay a city tax of 5 % of the room price. But you have to pay this tax everywhere in the Netherlands, not only at this hotel. Summary: I definitely can recommend this hotel!
UR8363435	Nice and peculiar place for resting. The worst part was the breakfast, nothing special. Room are amaizing ( I was in Aristoteles room) and the garden really pleasant
UR8236122	We have been in this hotel in May ! We were in 3 people. We chose it because first the price was very good comparing with what the other hotels were offering at the time and also we loved the idea of each room was decorated in different ways. We love boutique hotels! The localization was very good. It was near Van Gogh museum and 2 minutes walking from the park Vondelpark.. Also it was easy to come back from the center as there was a tram stop 5 minutes walking from the hotel. The room was nice but the bathroom was extremely small that I could not change myself inside without open its door. For us that we are tall it was a nightmare. Another detail that we did notice was that the room was quite dusty !! But apart from that it was ok! Also the TV did not have remote control and most of the channels were dutch so if we want to watch TV it was not possible! The service when we arrived was very warm. The problem started when we found out that we have to pay an extra tax that the hotel's manager said that was a "city tax" that we did not know about it as in the website that we booked the hotel did not show any extra tax to pay. What amazed me was that when we complaint to the manager the way that she behaved in my opinion far from give a best customer experience. If you want to go there the hotel is very nice but be aware of hidden taxes that at the end they will make you pay . A. M. , London, UK
UR8118026	The room was incredibly small, looked like a closet â€¦ in fact, I still havenâ€™t convinced myself it wasnâ€™t a closet. Most of the rooms at the Filosoof are named after famous philosophers and theologians (ie, the â€œConfuscius Roomâ€� or the â€œNietzche Roomâ€�). If I had to guess, my room was the "Shamanistic Ritual Room.â€� Staying there certainly bordered on a pagan rite â€¦ the elevator (such as it was) thumped and trembled the floorways all night, and joined the ongoing slamming of doors and voices of young stoners yammering until the very. Wee. Hours. The following morning, despite my better judgement, I decided to take a shower, but lo and behold, the hotel had no running water, surprise, surprise. When I called downstairs, the staff informed me the construction crews in the street had ruptured all the water lines. They noted that they would be glad to phone me when the hotel had water again. Never did get that call. Speaking of construction outside the hotel, the tangle of bulldozers and steam shovels, along with pools of swamp muck made navigating oneâ€™s way to the tram lines a Lewis and Clark affair â€¦ no place for fine shoes, ladies. I will never spend another night at Hotel Filosoof, as long as I have the strength to crawl to the nearest bus stop. At 130 euros per night, plus extra charges to make local calls on the phone, one would expect a lot more â€¦ or even a little more. Iâ€™m trying to remain philosophical about my experience at the Hotel Filosoof, but staying there again would require a leap of faith that goes beyond philosophy to blind superstition or stark, raving lunacy.
UR7867339	We stayed in the Spinoza room. This was over the road from the main building. It was very quiet and peaceful, no noise at all at night. The Spinoza room was quite big, by european hotel room standards and there was actually a small ante room with a double bed in it which made it a family room I suppose. The one thing I didn't like was that the room was rather dark and the bathroom was very small, but as I said we've stayed in smaller rooms elsewhere in Europe. As for the hotel proper, we thought it was rather charming. There was a choice of where to eat breakfast, we would have loved to eat in the garden but the weather was just too inclement. The breakfast was fine. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel wasn't in the centre of town, but it wasn't a long walk into town, we would recommend buying tickets for the hop on hop off canalbus.It was a great way to see the city and saved the legs. The kiosk is just at the bottom of Overtoom, at the Leidesplein. We ate at the Peper N Zout, which is on Overtoom, the main road into town. It wasn't cheap but it was very good. We would recommend visiting the Jordaan ( we ate at the de Zagerij cafe on Westerstraat...very good, hearty food and large portions) and the de Pijp area ( when the market is on...a lively area.)
UR7771165	The location of the hotel is great. 50 meters from Vondelpark, and the garden is great for breakfast. But the hotel proper is lousy. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are microscopic without shower doors, so the water flows onto the floor. The internet had been out for a while, with no indication that fixing it was urgent. On the morning I left, there was not hot water. Again, no urgency.
UR7595099	Good location in a nice neighbourhood, approx. 5 minutes by tram from the city center. Liked the bed, sheets. Breakfast was OK but just lacked a little sparkle.Where are the fresh croissants and some other sweets? Where is the fresh fruit salad? Yes, you offer apples and pears but when I am on holiday I want it ready cut! Friendly staff and welcoming lobby. Did not like the bathroom very much (room 135). Too small and below standard. As every room seems to be different, they might very well have other bathrooms which are very nice. But make sure you check. Sofa in the TV room was not very inviting. Management, please change it and put a normal, comfy sofa in!! Would recommand and would put this hotel in the top 20 of character hotels in Amsterdam.
UR7431920	Nice and "DIFFERENT" Hotel .. I will certainly recommend to visit that one.. really gentl staff and absolutly different place no comparison is possible agst all of those standard hotel around the world... Is better to see... not easy to explain and alm9ost unexpensive ... Carlos
UR7331382	Simply enjoyed my stay at the Filosoof. My wife and I stayed in one of the new spacious suites. It was located on the other side of the road, opposite of the hotel. Our room it must have been at least 60 square meters! A ballroom! Lovely furnised and decorated and located in such tranquility, downtown Amsterdam. Never stayed in such a nice and spacious room in Amsterdam. Reception staff was very helpfull and so was the barman (I think his name is Willem) who carried our bags to the room. De Filosoof is with no doubt one of the most friendly and unique hotels I have stayed in. A real find!
UR7185874	We stayed at Hotel de Filosoof in Amsterdam....what a great experience. (We had made a booking through an agency for a different hotel and through a mixup of the booking agent, our rooms not only weren't reserved (had been prepaid), but the hotel was full! Luckily, the staff got us rooms at the Hotel de Filosoof which turned out to be our good fortune!) Though there are rooms located in the hotel proper, our rooms were actually located across the narrow street from the hotel and were brand new....all new carpeting, new, modern tiled bathrooms, new mattresses which the staff said were from an ergonomics store...and they were so comfortable! Rooms, at the reasonable rate we paid, can be very small in Amsterdam, but our twin rooms had ample space. The street was very quiet, next to Vondel Park and within a few minutes' walk from the Museumplein; lots of restaurants and the trams on a cross street made the location perfect. The hotel has a nice sized lobby area with comfortable chairs and a bar...we enjoyed a drink and conversation after a busy day of sightseeing! The breakfast room is very nice....several areas in fact in which to have breakfast including a windowed porch. Breakfast was excellent with fruits, cereals, assortments of delicious breads and rolls, eggs, meats, cheeses, coffee, tea, etc. The breakfast staff was very courteous. Also, there is a very nice garden in the back of the hotel proper....various areas to sit with tables and wicker chairs, very quiet and quite lovely. There was a computer on which to check email....very convenient. The staff was truly exceptional - very friendly and kind, giving us tips on transportation, restaurants, etc. They recommended an excellent restaurant in the Jordaan area, Luwte on Leliegracht, a street that is around the corner from the Anne Frank House. We highly recommend this hotel for good value, great staff, comfortable rooms, great location. Kathy and Mike
UR6780916	This hotel was very warm and friendly. The hotel staff went above and beyond the call of duty to help me make transportation arrangements to get to Gent, Belgium. Since I speak no Dutch or Flemish, the female clerk at the front desk spent much time on the phone, then wrote all the information I needed in English, giving me very specific directions so I would not end up on the wrong train, and would not miss the train I had to change to in Antwerp. (Her English was impeccable.) My room was clean, comfortable, and I had no problems with it. I enjoyed all the philosophical quotes and pictures of great philosophers in the hallways, lobby, and my room. The buffet breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. There were many different foods to select from, and the coffee was the very good. My room had a nice view of a church and the hotel courtyard. The internet service was free, a fast connection, and there was no time limit if no one else was waiting to use it. There were enough nice restaurants to walk to in the area - which seemed like a safe and quiet neighborhood. The tram system was easy enough use, and next time I will buy a pass. The walk from the tram stop to the hotel was quick. I did not have nearly enough time in Amsterdam, and would like to go back. I would certainly consider staying in the Hotel de Filosoof again. While it is close to some museums, it was a little too far out from the main part of the bustling city- such as the Dam Square area - for me to want to go back out at night.
UR125767404	Great hotel, extremely central location right by the etiole tube station - quick links to everywhere on the RER and a proper view of the Arc de Triomphe from the hotel (unlike some others which claim to be near the arc de triomphe and are actually miles away) The decor is edgy, querky but not at the sacrifice of function. Room was great - it was only a standard room but it was big by paris standards and the mirror on the ceiling was definitely a talking point! Unlike others on this site, our bathroom was fine - the loo was separate from the rest of the bathroom and behind a proper door so no problem there, the bathroom was well laid out, just a curtain between that and the bedroom but no problem. Fantastic shower - like being in a monsoon! the shower head must have been a foot square, and enough water pressure to make it worth while. Staff were really helpful: as others have said and the welcome was warm and friendly. Local bars and restaurants offer a good choice of something to eat or drink and then of course you have the whole of paris to go at! The hotel does breakfast now, unlike some of the info given by other reviewers - in room or buffet style. All very efficient If I'm in Paris again soon I will definitely return.
UR125187693	Mac Mahon was conveniently located a block away from the Champs Elysees and the metro was less than 500 feet from us. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. When we first arrived, our room wasn't exactly what we wanted, and we were moved immediately and without question or extra charge to a larger room, with a shower and a lovely view of the top of the Arc De Triumphe. As all European lodging is usually tight, the room that was given to us was more than sufficient in space. Price for the location and space is unbeatable. We would definitely go there again when visiting Paris.
UR125171005	It is a very beautiful place to stay, only 1 min walk from the Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees and the metro station. Warm and homey atmosphere. We were impressed by the service of the receptionists gave us. Muhamed and especially Mia do everything to make you feel at home ( big smile, amazing attitude, they are always there to help you). The room was nicely designed and mirrors are fantastic. Only bad part is there is no parking but we will definitely go back no doubt!
UR125035241	My husband and I were given this 2 night stay as a wedding gift so had no input into the choice of hotel, but I must say, we could not have opted for a better place to stay. We were greeted by 2 of the most friendly hotel staff I have met - who also spoke perfect English, which helped after a nightmare journey (tip - for 55 euros you can get a taxi from the airport. worth every penny as the train was horrible and took AGES - and we had to get a taxi from the station anyway!) Upon finding out we were on honeymoon, they immediately upgraded our room and we ended up with the most amazing view of the arc de triomphe. The room was spacious, flawlessly clean and beautifully decorated with the most comfy bed I've ever slept in. You're able to book open top bus tickets from the hotel reception and it's just a short walk to the Champs Elysees where the bus picks up, worth doing as this is the easiest way to see Paris in a short time. I would absolutely stay in this hotel again.
UR123535637	It is an elegant and beautiful hotel, just after total renovation. Design is made in Napoleon and historical French style â€“ very interesting. There is no breakfast in hotel, so the best option is restaurant in opposite side of the street. However you are free to choose any other cafÃ© (there are lot of them in nearest streets) to get a fresh croissant and coffee in the morning. Personal was really friendly and glad to help (book a taxi or tickets to opera) so I passed 3 very good days in Paris. Wifi is free in lobby and rooms.
UR123261052	A stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe and a stop on the #1 line on the metro, this hotel is ideally located - close enough to the action and yet far enough away to be quiet and relaxed. The proximity to the metro station makes the entire city very accessible. The hotel was recently made and has modern amenities, a modern layout and a helpful, cordial staff that makes the entire stay a pleasure. Compared to the other hotels that I considered, this was fantastic value for money for what we received.
UR121600069	This hotel is amazing, it is still under renovation so when its complete i think it will be outstanding for the price you pay, especially in that area of paris. The welcome you recieve, the staff at the hotel and the quality really made our 4 night stay. The hotel is ideally located with the Arc de Triomphe about 200m away, the Metro and RER are close by making it very easy to explore this fantastic city... Highly reccomend this Hotel, we will definetly stay at this hotel again when we visit again.. Alan and Gaia
UR121362742	What a nice place. It's small, but that is what we expected from an older Parisian hotel. The service is excellent, with room rates that won't break the bank. The room we had was quaint, with a balcony that had a view of the Arc! Sleep with the patio doors open and take in the city smells and sounds. Great location. Close to the subway, the Champs, and fine restaurants. Recommended highly.
UR121312141	Me and my husband stayed in hotel Mac Mahon for my birthday from 26.11 to 28.11.2011. We booked a standard room, but were upgrade to a suite.The hotel is amassing.The lobby was still in renovation. Everithing is brand new and the furniture and fittings high quality.The location is perfect for going around Paris.The staff was very friendly and everyone speaks good English.It was our first time in Paris and Mac Mahon made it unforgettable experience.The property deserves another star(I work in the hospitality industry in London myself).We are definitely coming back there.I strongly recommend the hotel. M.Pavlova,T. Pavlov
UR120625599	The Hotel has just being renovated to a high standart, so dont pay attention to any reviews done before november 2011 because they really dont describe the new hotel and will end up putting you off. I stayed at mac mahon for a weekend break with my partner and we loved it. The reception and hotel facilities are still being done, but the bedroom was amazing, really confortable and funky, extremelly clean, flat screen TV, ipod dock and lovely decor (including a very sexy ceiling mirror...) the bathroom is really nice, with a spa shower and so close to metro and champs elyzees. (I've checked the new hotel pictures at booking.com) Highly recommend this hotel.
UR120471826	Altough the hotel was still under construction (lobby and some floors) plus the fact that some services were not operational like the kitchen we had a very pleasant stay and i am sure when the redecoration is finished this hotel will live up to the standards of the surrounding neighborhood. The location is fantastic, just a couple of meters from the Arc. The rooms were great, clean. The bed was very comforable and the bathroom oustanding. Staff was friendly and good english spoken. Would recomand this hotel and rate it 8 out of 10.
UR120191731	Newly decorated hotel. Beautiful room, located right in the heart of Paris. Free wifi. I like it very much. I'm not sure for the service as the first floor was under redecorated, no breakfast, but there are many cafe and restaurants near by, so not problem at all.
UR127728915	very good restaurant near the hotel, park outside the hotel . the garage is not so good service from the reception can be better
UR126406334	We spent one night here. The hotel is not so far from Tegel airport but bear in mind that you have to change at least twice to get there by public transportation. The room was perfect for such a short stay, the staff was very kind and helpful.
UR124381162	Ibis Tegel is outside the city center, but not far away from the subway station. The rooms are clean and very decent (typical Ibis standard). Double bed, TV, moderately spacious rooms and decent bathroom. I am only a bit dissapointed that I didn’t get any help from the staff when I got sick (no first aid set, no pills). However, I am not sure whether it is not againt a law to provide guests with medications.
UR121704493	Nice standard Ibis hotel with a wonderful staff. Great location proximal to both the S- and U-bahn. Nice family neighborhood in Altreinecker.
UR121242223	Stayed there one night during weekend. Although hotel is located far away from Berlin center it has a good connection via undergroud Residenzstrasse station located few steps from the hotel. It is located not far from Tegel airport but I did not nottice any noise caused by airplanes. Breakfast is 10Euro but offers a wide selection of food. Hotel parking is 7 euro but I did not use it as it was relatively easy to find parking lot at the street. Hotel staff is friendly, helped me to find the hotel when I was driving and my navigation failed. It is not a brand new hotel as other Ibis hotels i visited in recent years, you can nttice some signs of wear but all areas are cleaned. Hotel room was for double occupancy but I used it as single room and paid some 59 euros incl. breakfast. Iwould recommend this hotel for single travellers with limited laguagge since room space is not very large.
UR120980657	Standard Ibis fare. Cheapish and cheerful. Handy just for crashing in. Small issue when we arrived late evening there was no opportunity to buy snacks. We'd missed out on dinner due to travelling and couldn't even get a bag of peanuts. Despite signs saying food available 24/7.
UR119554998	I did not use the car park as there was space on the street. The check-in was quick and the room was just right for a one night stay. No noise even though the airport is relatively near. Passed on the breakfast because I only eat a light one and 10EUR would be high for a bowl of cereal. Overall a very pleasant stay.
UR118811716	Been all over europe 5X, east and west. Although far from the city center, Ibis Tegel Airport is clean, quality accomodation and a short walk to UBahn and Bus stop, If you are headed for City center, Take U8 and U9. If you are headed for the airport, the bus 122 takes you to KShumacher platz and transfer to Bus 128 for Tegel airport, a short trip. A slim lady who checked in and checked us out was not a nice hotel worker, unfriendly in other words. She should be transferred to a back office out of face to face customer service IMO.
UR118206589	It was our first trip to Germany, where we chose this hotel by recommendation. Excellent ambient, market facility nearby, U-Bahn station Residencestrasse very close. Our recommendation goes to all those searching for budget hotel at Berlin.
UR116605107	I highly recommend this one, because it is very clean, good quality and provides easy access to the U-Bahn (metro). I used it for an overnight stopover at Tegel airport for a "Insider Walking Tour" of Berlin the next day.
UR115604283	Nice and clean hotel. Friendly staff. Good breakfast. Location at the beginning of street with park was also good; It was nice to go walk there in the evenings. Hotel location was good enough. U-bahn is only 500 meters away. You get straight to Alexanderplatz! Also short trip to Tegel with train + bus.
UR115589227	We stayed here for 1 night - and for 2 reasons: price and location. We were able to book a twin room for 49 Euro - asked for two single beds but got one queen size bed at checking. Location is excellent - near the Tegel airport and in the midst of a typical old-charm Berlin neighborhood. Rooms were clean, bathrooms were spotless. Reception staff was professional but not helpful when asking for advice on dinner or sightseeing options. That is the major reason for not grading it above "average." The other issues to consider is the extra cost of breakfast at 10 Euro a person and parking fee of 7 Euro per day. Will stay again - room price alone makes it a good deal. Best for business stay.
UR115190545	The hotel has all the basic facilities (but no restaurant, only bar). It makes a fine buy if you like to tour around Berlin all day and return to hotel only for Bed & Breakfast. It is, however, many stations away from Berlin Tegel airport and you have to change once to reach here. Also not near from Berlin Hauptbahnhof (have to change from Alexander Platz) Overall IBIS standard is maintained.
UR113169179	My wife and I spent 10 days over a 1-month period in this hotel. When we arrived, the desk clerk could not find our reservation. I presented a copy of it to her, but she refused to look at it. I provided our names and passports for identification, but she still refused to look at them and simply claimed she had no record of a reservation. Finally, after insisting that she check again, she found it and stated that the name was listed wrongly (reversed) even though our written copy of the reservation stated it correctly. She was generally rude, unapologetic and indifferent to us. The room itself was spare but acceptable, given the low rate we paid. In the end, the same rude clerk ended up giving our hotel points to two different accounts, again ignoring my club card ID number. Disappointing and not recommended unless you are desperate.
UR107950110	we booked from ibis website 1 month before we travel, so the price is 39 euro per night. The Room is clean and new, in quiet area with many restaurants. There is also a Penny supermarket with walking distance. Parking 7 Euro/day, breakfast 10 Euro is too much! In front of hotel there are some parking places if you are lucky!
UR100948454	we checked in ath night about 23:00 the receptionist was trying to help but so slow. it took 20min to check in. While checking out in the morning the receptionist lady was looking very unhappy and talked with me as i was quilty os something. This is not kind of a behaviour i would like to see in the morning when i am staying at a hotel.
UR95505798	this hotel is close to tegel airport, about a 10min cab journey. staff were pleasant, and everything was what you would expect from ibis. the subway station is about 5 min walk, and there are a couple of food shops about, and a good restaurant right next door! free net in the lobby.
UR63050648	Clean, seemingly newly remodeled Ibis tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood (Reineckendorf) near Tegel airport; pleasant 10 minute walk from Paracelsus Bad U8 station. Eateries adjacent. Staff cordial and helpful, arranged taxi to airport efficiently at 5 am. Like other Ibises we've stayed in, street noise precludes sleeping with the windows open, so the room was a bit warm at night.
UR49569051	Stayed seven nights in an Ikea-like room. I was impressed how clean everything was. There was no noise from Tegel Airport nor from the street in front which had a low speed limit posted. Free internet access in the lobby was helpful; the breakfast buffet had quality.
UR23964488	Booked through a German hotel reservations company, hrs.de and was highly impressed with it, will use them again. Got into Berlin Tegel early from Amsterdam after KLM flight from JFK. I had the day before called ahead to set up our rooms (2 twin rooms) for early arrival with the manager. After our adventurous cab ride from the airport, we got to the hotel @ 11AM, and sure enough, the girl at the front desk had the rooms ready and waiting, check in was a breeze. I was there with 3 of my buddies, we dropped off our bags, and headed out to see the sights, it was our one and only day in Berlin, unfortunately. The hotel was very clean, I don't think it had free internet, but to us that was no big deal. Rooms were about average size, bed wasn't the biggest for a twin, but I've slept on worse. Bathroom and shower was decent. The hotel was a 5 minute walk from a U-bahn stop, I forget which one, but it's very convenient. From there you can get to all over Berlin and the myriad of sights to see, we saw as much as we could in 1 day, I think. After we were done sightseeing, there was a little bar/restaurant right outside of the main entrance where we had our dinner, the waiter spoke excellent English (despite his claims only speaking "a little" - why do all Germans say that when they usually are very proficient?!) and was hilarious...and on top of that, the food and beer was delicious. All around a great, fun dinner experience for our rapidly tiring selves. After that went back to our rooms, turned on the TV and watched some German programs before zonking out. The room and area was very quiet, esp for a Friday night, no rowdy drunks or parties or anything. Woke up in the middle of the night, but that was due to time zone screwup, not the bed, which was quite comfortable. There was no free breakfast the next morning, but there was one of the delicious, ubiquitous pastry shops around the corner, and we stocked up before catching our train to Frankfurt. I definitely recommend the Ibis Tegel, great service, comfy rooms, and excellent location.
UR18209359	We stayed one night in May and one night in July 2008 at the start and end of our German holiday. We were very happy with the hotel each time and would certainly stay there again. From Tegel airport we took the #128 bus to Residenzstrasse and walked about 8 minutes to the hotel. (2.10 euros per person, pay the driver, he can give change). Going back to the airport for an early flight we took a taxi (18 euros inc tip). We found the front desk friendly and helpful and the rooms were basic but very clean, quiet and comfortable which was all we needed. I booked the room on the Ibis website and got a very good internet rate. The excellent buffet breakfast is extra. The free internet in the lobby is a nice bonus. There are a couple of bistro/restaurants nearby for suppers.
UR7831537	Berlin normally offers plenty of accomodation at reasonable rates. But sometimes the German capital can be very busy, like during the G8 summit meeting. Then I like to return to one of the first ibis locations, which I know for more than 20 years. The location is between TXL and the new Central Railway station (taxi 10 € from TXL). I know about their good service, I get an attractive rate, I am checked in 15 min after leaving Tegel airport. Location, price and service that's what counts for me. You'll find the usual ibis furniture, rather small rooms, but a good buffert breakfast. And a few restaurants around for dinner or just a beer or Berliner Weiße. In the off season I choose more attractive offers of the big chains (e.g. the new Novotel Tiergarten), but (secret !) I always get a room in Reinickendorf, even at convention times.
UR126273976	It was my first time in Rome. The hotel is situated very close to the Vatican. I received a 1st floor room with twin beds, which unfortunately have wheels, so if you turn from side to side you left with the bed.Cleaning was ok, large bathroom, prety old, terrible view, bars and wall of ventilation system. Breakfast very poor compared to other NH Hotels: scrambled eggs, bacon, croissants, ham, salami, fruit, yogurt, cereals, tea and coffee from the dispenser, juices from the dispenser. The staff is quite unfriendly, do not smile, like most Italians working in hospitality services. Distance is 10 minutes walk from the Vatican, Piazza del Popoplo 5 minutes, where you can walk to Piazza Spain, Fontana di Trevi, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Navora, Coloseum and all the touristic atractions. Dobledecker rides are an alternative that are not so expensive compared to those in London or Paris. We chose Cristiana tour company. The price is 16 euros for two days, although in the brochure isn~t written. Headphones do not work and tour lasts not more than one hour Rome is a cute capital , with many tourist attractions and can be visited in three days. Nh Leonardo was not the nicest hotel but the position is ok.
UR124545601	This was a great place to stay. Located in a residential part in the Prati district. Room was very clean. Great for resting after a long flight. The breakfast buffet is really good, not just your standard "american"breakfast. Lots of italian pastries to start your day. Short walk from Lepanto station. Close to Vatican too We walked all over Rome it was amazing.
UR123604921	We enjoyed our staty at the NH Leonardo da Vinci hotel. It was very clean and modern. The room was a little on the small size but had lots of storage and a nice size bathroom. The breakfast was very good. The hotel was in a very quiet neighborhood but only steps away from shops, resturants and transportation. The staff was very helpful. We enjoyed being able to walk to many of the wonderful sites of Rome and returned to our comfortable, quiet room for the evening.
UR122281260	This was a nice hotel located in a great part of Rome. Easy access to the vatican (two blocks) great restaurant right arund the corner. Ask the concierge for the name. My wife and I walked to all the plazas and fountains. we easily walked 5-6 miles a day. It was good to work off the food and wine. Back to the hotel. Clean and neat. It is not a fourseasons grade but is worth the price for the location and it has all the basics.
UR122009925	Like most European hotels, the AC is off during the winter months, which can be frustrating for those like me , who like to sleep in cool conditions. Open the window and you can get there, maybe with ear plugs. Beds are average at best, rooms are very small, and the pillows are the worst! They must take down pillows and wash them untill they form into little balls! That aside, the staff is friendly, breakfast is usually free (based on your reservation), and the location for the price is great.
UR121810084	I stayed twice at this hotel last summer and have mixed feelings. The location is OK, in a quiet residential area, and at walking distance to Vatican and Piazza Navona. The first time I stayed I was put in a renovated room, which was very nice. I had heard about bed bugs, so I checked everything and can confirm there was no issue in my room. The second time I stayed, was a big surprise !!! I opened the door to find an old and smelly room the size of a closet !!! Had to put my suitcase sideways so it would fit between the twin bed and the wall !! Having the experience of the renovated room, I went back to the front desk and asked to be relocated. I was told so many different stories : 1. there was no other room available, and to come back the next day. to which I had to argue that some people from my company were leaving later that day, and for sure their rooms will be made available ! then I had the 2nd story : OK, you will have to wait after 16h00 (in 2 hours). I told the lady I would wait and handed her my NH fidelity card and suddenly a key for a renovated room appeared in my hand ! (...) . Being aware of that and having seen the huge difference in the quality of the rooms, I would not recommend this hotel to someone going on vacation, knowing there are chances that they will be given an old room and might not be able to change for a renovated room. Once all the rooms are renovated, I believe this will be a decent hotel and would recommend it for a stay in Rome.
UR120013172	This would be my 11th stay at this property since 1992. I have watched the hotel go through all kinds of changes. This visit I was in a room on the 2nd floor, and the rooms are getting a bit tired, however, in Rome, quiet comfort is key. If you are a busy tourist, you need your sleep. I have stayed at other hotels with much more "character" and got much less sleep. If you like a sociol scene in the hotel bar, or the charm or an old world hotel, go elsewhere. If you want a good nights sleep, in one of the best locations in Rome, this is it. Best breakfast buffet in Rome.
UR119954969	We booked for three nights prior to our cruise. The location is very convenient. Located in a safe neighborhood near the Vatican. Great breakfast. We booked a shuttle to pick us up and deliver us to the port. The room was not large, but quite comfortable. I would stay there again.
UR119722944	We stayed here 3 nights and although the rooms are quite small for european standards it was quite pleasant. All the hotels we stayed in in Italy had horrible mattresses...hard as a rock...The breakfast buffet and the location of the hotel are really great! We would definitely consider staying here again!
UR119581039	For the price it is outstanding. The location can't be beat. 15 min walk to Vatican, 20 walk to other major attractions. Free WiFi in lobby (30 min intervals) worked fine. I would stay there again.
UR118191838	The NH Leonardo in Rome is in a great location. Near the Vatican and the river, it is a short walk to the Piazza Navona, Piazza del Popolo and Cola di Rienzo, which has great shopping. The hotel staff is very helpful a courteous. The rooms are small and need updating, however, and they can overwhelm the a/c in really hot weather. Good complimentary breakfast though!
UR118072689	On a longer weekend trip to Rome we choose this NH venue as it was the best for the price. One of the top's is definately the location. It is close to the Vatican and its sites, also only ten minutes walking distance to Villa Borghese and the famous Via del Corso. The next bus stop is just around the corner and a metro station in walking distance (5min.). When we checked in they had a major breakdown of the computer system. We had to come back in one hour (we used this time to go for lunch). For sure, it wasn't the best first impression of the staff; however, in the following days they were nice and helpful. Especially with insider tips they eased our stay. The hotel is a former Jolly Hotel which is remarkable in some corners. The room was rather small tough. I have seen bigger room Standart Rooms in NH Hotels (even in Italy - Bologna). The ammendities were available and always stuffed up and the bathroom cleaned perfectly. Since it is a popular hotel with tourists due to the proximity to the Vatican and also a crew hotel for major Northamerican airlines the restaurant was very packed during breakfast. We had to wait a little to get seated. The breakfast is included in the room price and offers a continental style breakfast. Especially the fresh juices were very welcomed by us. Other than that nothing really special, just a breakfast. You have WLAN just in the lobby. It says 30min only, but they are more than happy to give you 3-4 or more passwords. You just have to ask at the reception. Overall, the hotel was OK and recommandable, if you are here just to visit the city instead of sitting in the room the whole day. Well, we just came to sleep.
UR117952915	Very close to the Vatican and very good restaurants near by. A comfortable walk to Piazza Navone and Campo Dei Fiori. The staff isn't efficient or very accommodating. Very good buffet breakfast served complimentary. The room is of good quality but not the most up to date and the beds are not the most comfortable. This hotel is moderate in room but recommended for the neighborhood and location.
UR116978878	Unfortunately, we were in Rome while some lunatic set off a bomb in our home town Oslo, before starting a killing spree on Utøya. Sadly we had to stay in our room to follow events back home. Good thing they had both CNN & BBC - sad thing I had to pay expensively for internet access. Room looks a bit like a ferry cabin out of the seventies - they should something about that. Location is right between the Vatican and Piazza Del Popolo - you'll end up walking a bit to get around to the usual sights. Breakfast was OK, nothing more. Snacks and light meals that impress no one served outside the lobby. Landed here after taking a chance on Hotwire - wasn't expensive, but I really don't see any reason to choose this hotel again.
UR116402253	This is not a cheap hotel but you'd never guess that from the rooms. The rooms are so small that we literally had no room to even place our bags around the bed. The lounge downstairs was nice, albeit a little expensive but clean. The hotel does get very busy during the mornings with travelers coming and going and could use more help. The hotel is located very conveniently to many desireable places and we were able to walk to many restaurants and attractions.
UR115884100	I stayed here with my family (mother, father, sister) on the recommendation of a colleague. As with most European hotels, the room was not yet ready when we arrived from the US early in the morning. The desk staff worked quickly to secure our rooms, estimating 2-3 hours before the rooms were clean and ready for us. We explored the local neighborhood, browsing nearby shops, and stopping for a snack at one of the outdoor cafes. Approximately 1 hour later we inquired back with the hotel and were surprised to find that the rooms were ready for us (before noon!). Having visited Rome before my expectation was for a small room at best, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was fairly large (similar in size to a budget room in the US) with a large and clean bathroom. We attempted to shower to find that our rooms had no hot water. While disappointing, a call to the front desk had the problem remedied within minutes. The included breakfast is far beyond what was expected and included hot dishes consisting of eggs, bacon, and sausage in addition to a vast cold item selection. The lounge is lively in the evening until around midnight with guests returning to the hotel for a night cap after a busy day in the Eternal City. Overall, the hotel is clean, quiet, and a fantastic value off the beaten path in a vibrant residential area with great shopping and dining within walking distance.
UR115682969	+ : Good location, near the Vatican, Castel Sant'Angelo and Piazza del Popolo.Quiet area , clean room, good breakfast. - : In the back rooms the bed is right by the door, no corridor between them. Be sure to ask for a room that looks in the front. They asked for a credit card in order to use the room's safebox. Since we didn't have one, we had to carry a lot of money with us.
UR114835337	My wife and I spent only two nights in Rome before boarding a cruise ship for a 12 day Mediterranean and Greek Isles tour. Our room lodging in Rome was arranged through the cruise line and our travel agent. Since neither one of us had been to Rome before we were not quite sure what to expect. I must say we were very pleasantly surprised and very pleased with our hotel. Located just a few blocks off a main artery, the hotel was within easy walking distance from many restaurants and shops. Our first afternoon we walked to St. Peter's and the Vatican and stopped along the way for our first Italian pizza. The hotel itself was clean; the staff was helpful and pointed us in the right direction for dining, shopping, and touring. The buffet breakfast was excellent and service was good. Our room was very well appointed. I would recommend it and would stay there again.
UR112461520	I stayed here on June 5th and 6th 2011 it was not super luxurious but everything was really clean, no bugs of any kind ( I'm super vigilant!). The front desk staff was somewhat cranky but its to be expected in Italy, the Italians don't do customer service like in the US. They ARE bothered if you ask a question! The location is great about a 15 minute walk to historical center and a skip from St-Peter's. Residential area so you get to mingle with the locals if you have breakfast in the local "bar". A must try!
UR108180926	Located in a very quiet and aristocratic neighborhood. Only few meters from Plazza Cola di Lorenzo, less than 10 minutes walk to Piazza di Popollo, and 10 minutes walk to the Castel Sant'Angelo, and 5 minutes walk to the Lepanto metro station. Staying 4 nights, we found the room was rather small, but clean. The interior design was OK, but the furniture and the carpets, is rather worn and clearly needs renovation. Even the TV is an old Non LCD 14" set… The Bathroom was Nice and Clean. The breakfast is hearty, with scrambled eggs, mushrooms & bacon, ham & cheese, big variety of breads and croissants, yogurt, desserts, cakes, and variety of fresh fruits, Alas no vegetables: adding slices of tomatoes, slices of cucumbers and fresh pepper will make a big difference! The hotel caters large number of airline staff and pilots, and the total atmosphere is very cosmopolitan. The Limo service to the airport, strongly advised by the hotel staff, (Actually a simple white minibus…) cost 50 euros, came exactly on time, and is highly recommended!
UR107296951	I travel often for professional reasons this is the first time in over 15 years of travel that I have experienced such a thing in a hotel of that category. My stay was booked into the Leonardo da Vinci for a 3 night stay in April 2011. During the second morning, I noticed that a make-up article was missing. As I had used it the day before i knew for sure that I had it with me. I searched everywhere - thinking perhaps that I had misplaced At the time it never crossed my mind that someone would steal something in my hotel room. Not in a hotel of that category! I complained to the housekeeper and the hotel manager and all i was told was "we are sorry, but we don't know..." As for me, its not the cost of the article that bothers me (that was never my concern) but the fact that when I lock my room door I wish to feel safe, knowing that my possessions IN my room are secure. I would never feel safe in such a place again. Plus you have to pay extra to get a decent room - like I did - the least one would expect was absolute security.
UR107073506	Had very good experiences with NH but NOT in this hotel. I was given a VERY small room with NO hot water in the first day. I made sure this was communicated to the hotel and to my surprise in the second day there was hot water but NO water. The pressure was so small that I was not able to get a shower. Finally I explain this story to the front desk while checking out. Answer: Sorry. Summary: Hotel did not care to listen to solve my problem (actually they did but created another one), but at least I heard a sorry after paying EUR 160 per night.
UR104530801	We were very disappointed with this hotel and expected at least something decent from an NH chain. I personally travel frequently and cleanliness is very important to me in a hotel. The room was small, dingy and a bit depressing. the walls, carpet and headboard were filthy and disgusting. It looks like its about 20 years old and never renovated. We checked out after the first night even though we had originally booked for 3 nights. The only thing acceptable was the bathroom, and although we didnt try the breakfast, it seemed ok from the lobby. Would not recommend this hotel at all.
UR99481082	The front desk staff was okay, but we were told to avoid the old, grouchy guy, so we did. The others were okay. We liked everything about the place, that we tried. We were not able to use the weight room because you had to be checked by a doctor, so I didn't bother to ask at the front desk. I didn't need to iron and I didn't buy a meal at the expensive restaurant downstairs, but we loved the breakfast. We asked for a cab to the Termini station to catch the train to the airport. "Oh, don't worry, go have your breakfast and the cab will be here at 7:00." We came out and asked and then they called the cab, so we waited about 3 minutes. Then we drove to the station with no problems. But no one told us that it's a 15 minute very fast walk to the train, if you don't make a wrong turn. And the train leaves at 7:22. We barely made it, but we were lucky that we didn't make a wrong turn and had only carry-on luggage so we could run.
UR98510574	Had my IPAD stollen from the room. Filed a police report. Found out that they have many thefts in this hotel. Be careful!
UR96921258	This is my second time staying at the Leonardo Di Vinci. I chose this hotel for my group based on the location, quality and price. This hotel has a very nice breakfast, nice clean & quiet rooms with all the amenities needed. We were able to walk to all the sights and the front desk was very helpful. Before my group arrived I stayed at the Hotel Emmaus near the vatican and was so glad to leave that hotel for the Leonardo Di Vinci....
UR95287811	So I arrive, check in, a friend recommended the hotel. It states free internet which is a lie, it's free for 30 minutes in the lobby, it is 11 euros a day if you want full service in your room. Now the room, it is a shoe box, and I paid extra for bigger, the pillow is made of foam chips,didn't even now pillows were made of that. The bathroom, when you walk in the bidet is right there, however the toilet is hidden by the door, so you have to go in and then close the door to use the toilet. There is this large flourescent light over the mirror, you cannot turn just that off, it's all or nothing. Or these little reading lamps near the bed. I have not slept over night yet but not looking forward to it as I could feel the springs while sitting on it.
UR89391906	To paraphrase a christian saying (feels somehow appropriate in this context), it is easier to find a needle in a haystack, than a good hotel in Rome. While breakfast is better than in similar Italian hotels, and the interior design has the positive characteristics of most NH hotels around the world, this is still a quite mediocre hotel by any standard. Sleep quality was very poor, with the heated wooden frames around the room lights contracting with loud creaks for about an hour after switching off the lights, and cleaning maids gathering in front of the rooms at 8 o'clock in the morning, talking energetically and hissing at guests that had the nerve to sleep in a little longer. Internet connectivity in the room is not free, yet deliberately slow. And the shuttle to the airport, strongly advised by the hotel staff, cost 10 euros more than a regular taxi and came half an hour late without offering any explanation or apology. Location-wise, this is not a bad place to be, a 5-minute walk from Piazza del Popolo, and a 10-minute walk from the Castel Sant'Angelo.
UR85091187	Its in the heart of Rome, at a walking distance to practically everything. A ten minute walk to Vatican city, three minute walk to the subway station that will take you to all the attractions of the city within ten minutes. Very quiet area, no loud traffic. Breakfast was enjoyable, freshly squeezed orange juice, scrambled eggs, cheese and cold cuts, fresh croissants etc...Every night in the bar area, a pianist plays relaxing music. The room was small, bed felt like i was sleeping on a hay stack....actually a hay stack is more comfortable. The pillows are as fluffy as an F1 race tire! The front desk staff lacked professionalism, they were not very helpful, most of them were not even able to speak english!! The hotel is rated 4 stars... in north american standards, this hotel should not rate more than 3 stars...in terms of service and courtesy!
UR77580099	We booked our stay in this hotel, Leonardo Da Vinci located in Via de Gracci in Rome, near the Vatican. It was at the center of the historic sites of Italy. The hotel room we booked classified as 4 star is almost like to the 1 star hotels in the US and Canada. The room was awfully small without anymore space for bags or suit cases. It is located in a quiet street but the hotel caters mostly to airline staff and pilots. So they don't care much for private travelers. There is no iron in the room. You have to go to the top floor to iron your clothes and the room is closed at 8:00 PM and opens only at 9:00 AM. The elevators is too small, almost like the size of a phone booth. The lobby is elegant but not the rooms. There is a timer for hair dryer and it over heats. The air conditioning is not strong enough for hot weather. The meals are expensive. Breakfast is various and quite good. The counter person who received us always spoke in Italian, while we asked the questions in English. The restaurant staff spoke only Italian so an English speaking guy would have to use sign language. Over all, I would not rate this hotel as 4 star. It is simple a motel type for weary travellers in the desert of Arizona.
UR71170747	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights booking it through Lastminute.com's Top Secret Hotels. Paid just over £400 for the 5 nights B&B, which compared to other hotels, was great value. The hotel is UGLY from the outside, but inside, it's very nice. The area, seemed disappointing upon arrival, but once we'd explored, it fairly close to Plaza Di Popolo (about 10 min walk), Spanish Steps (15min), Vatican (15 min) etc... We arrived at around 11am, and were told no rooms were ready and check was at 2pm. i asked about an upgrade and was off'd a Superior Room for 10 Euro's a night (incl tax) and room was immediately available. We took it. Superior Rm (706), was acceptable, although very small. Air Con worked well, which was lucky, as it was VVV hot. 7th floor rear rooms have a view over rooftops, to green hillsides, which was pleasant, this floor also has small balconettes which other floors and front rooms don't have. Breakfast was good compared to other Italian offerings. Good selection continental with some hot bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages and mushrooms- All help yourself. We managed to find a swimming pool on 2nd day.... About 10 min walk. Walk down to Piazza Cavour to the river, and 'La Maison' is located on River lower path, adjacent to Castel Sant Angelo. 10Euro all day, including an excellent Calvin Klein Towel. Perfect to escape the heat and rest from site seeing! Apparently open mid June to Mid September. (I have added a photo of pool). Overall, I WOULD recommend this hotel based upon price. Not huge rooms, but clean and well air conditioned. Top tip, get the hotel Limo back to airport, back to Fiumcino Airport, we paid 50Euro.
UR69497888	We stayed here 2 nights as part of a Globus "Best of Italy" tour (which was great by the way). The rooms were nice and clean and are updated. The rooms were a little small by US standards, but I found them to be just fine. The bed was very uncomfortable however, it was really hard and felt like I was sleeping on layers of cardboard. Also the pillow wasn't that great either; it felt like it was filled with styrofoam-like rubber peanuts or something, very strange. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, by far the best out of the 6 hotels we stayed in throughout Italy. Wifi is free down in the lobby if you have your own laptop, you just need to get a password from the front desk to access it and it lasts 30 minutes. It was a bit of an inconvenience to get a password each time you wanted to use the Internet (morning and night for me) but at least it was free which was nice. The hotel is also fairly close to the Vatican, only about a 10 minute walk. To get there, just turn right when you exit the front of the hotel, turn left at the first street (which is about 50 feet from the front door), go one block and turn right which is the main street in the area. Then just keep going straight and you will run right into the Vatican. There are lots of banks, shops, and restaurants all along the way. If it hadn't been for the bed and pillow I would have given this 5 stars. Overall the hotel was pretty good.
UR66083626	This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel over the last few years. The rooms on the higher floors are usually quiet. Breakfast is good and the buffet lunch excellent value and quality.
UR66008473	Got this hotel for myself and my wife and another honeymooning couple. Got it as a Secret Hotel from LastMinute so very cheap. Very nice, clean modern hotel, rooms are very nice and perfect for our two-night stay.
UR55975337	The hotel is ideally situated within 15 mins of the Vatican and 5 mins to the Metro. The room we had was clean & roomy. A word of warning: If you are staying over the weekend make sure you get down to breakfast before 9am (or be prepared to share a table with strangers). The breakfast is a buffet affair, with both cooked and cold food available, I must say that we were impressed with the quality of the food.
UR55262762	A regular solo traveller in Europe I was initially pleased when I saw the hotel. In a good quite location near to the Metro and the Vatican. Clean room. However when I began to feel unwell and asked reception if they could give me the details of a doctor, preferably English speaking. All they could suggest was that I went to the hospital, which they could not even give me the telephone number or address of; they just said it is near by. So I asked where their internet salon was and no internet, they were between providers. Still unwell and not ill enough to go to a hospital I went to bed. The bed had a really nasty cheap and very uncomfortable mattress. Rang my husband and asked him to book me a flight home immediately. I had paid in advance so what an apalling waste of money. Back to pensiones for me.
UR48125135	The rooms are tiny tiny tiny.You bump into the bed when you walk in the room,there isnt anywhere to put your luggage on and if you are in the bathroom the door will hit you if opened. Front desk personel are not very friendly.
UR44785809	I booked this room pre-cruise for two nights specifically because of its location. Worked out well for the Vatican tour that we had booked for Saturday morning. Unfortunately, my wallet was stolen around the Piazza Navona area that afternoon. The staff was very kind in helping me cancel my credit cards both online and with the help of their computers (our cell phones did not work in Europe and the local internet place closed at noon on Saturday). The size of the room was adequate for our needs but the air conditioning couldn't keep up with the extreme heat and humidity in Rome during our stay. We took the duvet and comforter off the bed and slept with just a sheet for two nights. The breakfast was very good and the coffee was excellent. This hotel is located in a nice quiet neighborhood just several blocks from the Levanto Metro stop and there is a good selection of small restaurants and shops between the hotel and the Vatican area. Would definitely stay here again.
UR40107996	We are a couple from Greece and decided to visit Rome for first time. We read comments on trip advisors and we selected this NH hotel. We did not regret it all. Only few words could describe this hotel Best located hotel, close to Metro station, to bus station, to Vatican, to historical town center. Located at a very quiet neighborhood surrounded by trees. Very clean hotel with friendly staff. It is cheaper for its facilities compared to other hotels located at the same area. The best choice for somebody to relax and go for shopping.
UR39535577	Simply the best hotel that we visit in our tour in Italy. Very clean hotel, kind personel, large and reach breakfast very close to Batican city, very close to old city and very close to Coin Shoping Center. Synonymous to luxury.
UR39175387	I was underwhelmed by this hotel. It's a nice property in a good location -- close to the Vatican and one block off a vibrant shopping area, although the street it's on is very quiet. I booked my room on Hotwire, and it was a good price, but the room was very small -- just enough room for 2 double beds. It was clean and the beds were comfortable enough, but not what I would expect from a hotel of this star rating. The staff was polite but a bit cold. I guess the kicker for me was the internet service: I inquired at the front desk and was told I could purchase 30 min of access for 5 euros! (Or 1 hour for 10 euros). I understand that most hotels charge these days for internet, but that seemed a bit ridiculous. Overall, given the many hotels at this price range in Rome, I wouldn't come back here.
UR38163964	No wireless in the rooms. Only in the lobby and it's not free, it costs 10 euro per hour. That was the only disappointing thing in this hotel. Except from this, everything was excellent
UR34356416	Comfy beds, good a/c, bathroom could be bigger but still good. Quiet neighborhood. Very good breakfast buffet. Staff was courteous and helpful. Close to Metro stop. Walking distance to Vatican, Spanish Steps, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and more. Good gelato and lots of nice eateries and shopping around the corner. Would stay again.
UR33756525	At the reception, the staff kept saying a audio guide of Rome I bougth on mail had not arrived.When I complain with the seller, he sent me a copy of the receip, signed at the reception
UR28947046	Lovely clean hotel, close to the Vatican city. easy walking distance for anyone. set in an almost semi residential location make this hotel nice and quiet. Great service from reception staff. Breakfast was lovely and there was loads of it. everything from full english to yoghurt and cereal and fruit. we booked our rooms on last minute .com on one of the secret deals. the rooms were very nice and clean, with great bathrooms (bath and shower with good pressure). my only criticism is that the rooms although lovely were a little on the small side. however we were only there for 1 night so not bothered. Overall very good.
UR28864896	Very central located. Walkind distance from Vatican and Castel Sant'Angelo. Everything is clean and beautiful, but the rooms a little small. The breakfast is delicious.
UR21439162	We stayed 2 nights in this hotel. It was very convenient for walking to the Vatican, the Piazza del Popolo, the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain etc. The room was very small but neat, clean and with decent amenities. The people behind the desk acted like they hoped you would walk away rather than determine the customer's needs. Just okay.
UR20432382	The room we had was very nice... Luxurious, great size, modern... Didn't have any problems with the front desk... The restaurant workers did have a bit of an attitude; I stood there for 5 minutes waiting for the "greeter" to acknowledge my presence which was IRRITATING. He said we couldn't eat at the restaurant w/out a reservation (but there was nobody in there at the time)... When I had stopped by the bar earlier in the afternoon to ask the bartender a question (i.e. - when would the restaurant open), it was the same thing; I had to stand in front of him for about 5 minutes before he'd acknowledge me... We just ended up eating at a restaurant down the street... The gentleman who drove us to the airport in the hotel car seemed nice enough (kinda formal/stuffy, but nice)... The location was a bit of a walk from all the touristy areas, but not too far...
UR20063299	Having just returned from staying at this hotel, I would say that the Leonardo da Vinci Rome is suitable for company representations/ business trips, but at the same time giving reasonable access to the major tourist attractions in Rome. I was attending a conference there and the hotel suited my needs perfectly. It is however about a 45 minute coach ride to the "Fiera di Roma" conference centre. To get to the conference centre by Metro is a slightly more complicated affair. To get to the Metro from the hotel is around an 8 minute walk (Lepanto Station) and and after having changed the Metro line you need to catch a shuttle bus to the conference centre from "Laurentina" station. Never-the-less I would still recommend you stay in Rome itself where the city is thriving rather than the more desolate conference area. The hotel itself is walking distance to the Vatican and also to Piazza Navona. In the interests of giving a balanced view,I personally did not encounter any problems with the reception staff. They were polite, courteous and helpful. They even booked reservations for us at the Galleria Borghese. I also found the beds reasonably comfortable and gave me a good night's sleep. The rooms were cleaned to a good standard and the toiletries provided were the fresh citrus smelling products by "Agua de la Tierra." In summary the hotel is a smart clean and comfortable but somewhat lacks the "wow factor" that would make a return stay worthwhile.
UR19769735	We stayed on Leonardo Da Vinci Hotel with my boyfriend on a romantic escape to Rome. The hotel is very clean, well situated (within walking distance to most tourist attractions of Rome) and in a very quiet place. Our Room was nor big nor small but OK for the circumstances as we didn't go to Rome on the first place to spend time on the Hotel... Everything that matters was in accordance to our expectations. The room and the bathroom was very clean and the staff really helpful. Having heard a lot of bad staff for Rome Hotels ,Leonardo Da Vinci was a pleasant surprise to us. Leticia
UR17759807	I booked this hotel through the internet on a very short term - almost at the Last Minute as it were. This is at best a 3 star hotel (not 4, which must be self-appointed). The location cannot be faulted: it is central, yet very quiet. That's the good news. So what's the bad news? This: Some of the front desk staff (this particular group work as a team) are, without doubt, the rudest and least helpful people I have ever met in my entire life as a hotel customer (in over 25 years of business and pleasure travel). I could give details, but why bother? Simply put, the front desk controls all, and I mean all, facilities in the hotel, including reservations, internet access, key cards, you name it - and if they don't feel like helping you, you aren't getting a reservation, a key card, a taxi, internet access, or any other service today - period. Surprisingly, several other reviewers have commented on this for at least the last 2 years, but the service has not improved (I read their reviews *after* parting with my credit card details, natch), yet to be fair (and this is in a way unfair) some of the front desk staff go out of their way to try to compensate for their colleagues' transgressions. They really do. But do you want to bet your Holiday of a Lifetime on their being available to help you? Avoid, avoid, avoid....
UR17305585	Great Location, Great Rooms There are two types of rooms, besides the suites referred to earlier. If you know Rome, you know this is a good place to stay.
UR17162561	After reading the initial reviews, I was a little spectical, especially with the front desk. However, I found the staff very helpfull and courteous. The rooms were a decent size, excellent black-out curtains, quiet with air-con and clean. Marble bathrooms and comfortable double bed - everything you would expect from a 4* hotel infact. The breakfasts were very good - a choice of fresh fruit juices (not those watered down type either!), bacon eggs etc, pastries etc. The location is about 15 mins walk from both the vatican and the piazza Navona across the river - so good, and also in a residential area. The hotel clientelle were mainly American tourists or Italian businessmen/women - I can't remember any children - which we were happy about! Oh the restaurant was so relaxing, even a pianist was playing so elegantly to set the scene. Yes, I would go back!
UR15962119	Hello, We stay here with Perillo Tours in April 2008. It was a nice hotel. Clean rooms, nice bar, and A/C on year round. Most hotels in Italy do not run the A/C until the month of June. Location was not bad for some local attractions, but not in the heart of town. Walking to main areas about 15 Minutes give or take. Good for one or two night stays.
UR11889733	Stayed here for 5 nights on a businness trip. The hotel was not booked by myself but by the company I was visiting. I would not have booked it myself after staying here. Mainly because I had to travel each day to the train station Termini and from there take the train to Ciampino. That meant 2 hours after waking up. Obviously I would have chosen a hotel in Ciampino..... Anyway, this is to rate this hotel. I would say it is a normal hotel, nothing special. I've been in bigger single rooms though. Breakfast was not really special, not a lot of healthy options. Staff during breakfast hardly said goodmorning to you. Also the bar is nothing special, it's missing atmosphere. Location of the hotel is ok, 5 minutes walk to the Metro Lapante. 30 minutes walk to the Vatican.
UR10846524	Stayed at this property for a week on business with a colleague. We enjoyed an upgraded multi-level suite on the top floors which included the bedroom and sleeping area on the second level and a larger living area on the main floor. This was perfect for our work efforts. Other rooms in the hotel were fairly typical in size and appropriation for this class of hotel. Whereas numerous other reviews have noted the front desk staff was unaccommodating we found exactly the opposite with two different people going out of their way to provided assistance with our needs. WiFi Internet connectivity was available albeit by purchasing scratch cards from the front desk and at an extremely high rate per day. If you need Internet connectivity whilst staying here check in advance to see what the current plan is. The location is great - a short walk to both public transportation as well as the Vatican City, shops and restaurants.
UR10056873	Rude, We heard from other reviews that front desk was rude but location good. We are easygoing people so thought that location was paramount and we could handle front desk with a sunny attitude....Wrong! Don't stay here, rude im still in shock because it felt so personal. We check in during the day (don't know if it's a scam but were told our res has been cancelled) so asked were we could find an international calling card and were told over there as he walked away! Where the heck is over there when you just got off a taxi from the airport! No help No service You are soooo on your own at their mercy. We were offered a room for 200 euros, please, we had already paid from home and felt this was a cashgrab. After sorting thing out with our travel agent they finally came to tell us our room was ready and that there was "a" mistake, not theirs, no apologies just attitute and the front desk guy did not look us in the eye for the rest of our stay, why would that be??? Don't trust a word they say, some front desk people said it was impossiple to walk to the trivi fountain and others said it was a ten minute walk, if you stay triple check all info and even then you will get mixed info. It put a sour taste in our mouth and would spend the extra dough to stay in another hotel, that is my only regret about rome. The rooms are super tiny and the location while good is not great so fellow travellers keep shopping you can do better than this for that fabulous european vacation!
UR10053522	This hotel was a huge disappointment for us. Our room was very small - no table and chairs. Just a small chair and then a desk and chair. Just seemed cheaply appointed for the price and area. The bathroom was small. All of this would have seemed insignificant if the food had been any good. The food at this hotel is terrible!!! Everyone in our tour group was complaining about the food and two couples even left to go eat somewhere else. Also, it would be nice to come down to the lobby area and have some sort of reception area where we could at least get a cup of coffee. The coffee in the restaurant was 2.50 Euros for about 2 tablespoons of horrible coffee. This place was conveniently located to shopping and restaurants. We definitely would not stay here again.
UR8603849	I come to the Jolly often for business. The best part is the location - it's hard to beat...close to restaurants, shopping, and tourists attractions...most things in Rome are within 30-45 minutes walk, and there is plenty within the 15-20 minutes vicinity to keep you busy. Bathrooms are always clean and stocked with extra amenities. That's about it for positives...the negatives - the hallways smell which reflects the overall cleanliness of the hotel...I dont think the rooms ever get a good scrub-down. That, and the front desk staff is probably the rudest i have ever seen at any hotel...then again, its typical italian customer service...i.e. non-existant...if you come to Italy with the "custome is always right" attitude, you are going to be fighting an uphill battle...try to go with the flow and have a sense of humor...and on that note, despite that fact that most front desk staff with stand there for five minutes and look busy before acknowleding you, there are a few kind ones with some charm.
UR8052141	This hotel is located reasonably convenient to subway, Vatican and even the historic center. The room was fairly small but very clean and modern. This hotel is in a fairly residential neighborhood so there are a few restaurants and some shopping nearby. Breakfast was OK, although the "hot" part wasn't hot at all. Front desk staff left much to be desired.. Wireless Internet access is 5 euros for 30 minutes (but doesn't need to be used all at once) and the signal was fairly weak in the room.
UR7858221	Perhaps it was because we were in a tour group, but the service at this hotel was incredibly sub-par compared to about half a dozen other hotels that we stayed on our recent visit to Italy. Everything about the service was horrible, from the attitudes of the front desk and bar, the refusal to provide change from bills into coins, and the directions to closeby locations in walking distance. There are many other hotels in Rome with much better service than this. Although the location is near the center of Rome, there are much better located hotels as well. Take a pass on this one.
UR7712616	Having read previous reviews on this hotel, we were quite apprehensive, but needn't have been. It is only about half an hour away from the airport and in a very nice residential location. One of the comments was that the staff were unfriendly and didn't speak English, though we found it to be quite the opposite. Reception staff were most pleasant, as were the restaurant staff and their English good. The hotel restaurant provided good food, in our opinion, even if rather expensive. As we live in Malta, we found everything expensive by comparison, not being used to City prices. We had a superior room, which was excellent, if a bit small. We even had 2 bathrooms, one fully equipped for disabled use. It is only 10 minutes comfortable walk to the Vatican, even in 33 degrees of heat we had during our visit. The queues for St. Peter's were horrendous, but we managed to get straight in to the Vatican museums, although we were told we would have to queue. The Red Bus 110 tour starting at the station termini was excellent, hop on, hop off and valid for 2 days, though we only used the ticket for one day. Again, it being so hot, we didn't even get off the bus. Shame really. So much to see. Rome is frenetic and the traffic frightening, but we did as the Romans do and walked with care out onto the pedestrian crossings. The cars actually stopped for us, though they didn't if we just waited to cross. There are plenty of 'green man' crossings though. All in all a most enjoyable visit and a pleasant hotel.
UR7615428	Service Dates: 5/2 - 5/4 2007 Nice hotel, room was adequate and clean. I found the hotel staff to be a bit aloof in the dining room and a manager at the front desk totally unhelpful. We were with a Perillo tour and the staff at the hotel (primarily the dining room) let you know they really did not care for those on tours (perhaps it was just that they did not really care for Americans who comprised our tour). The location of the hotel is a small negative in that to see anything in Rome a VERY LONG walk was required. A taxi is required to get to a good restaurant or one of the many spectacular sites in Rome.
UR7394542	The hotel is in a great location with close proximity to the Vatican and Piazza del Popolo. But...the staff at the front desk leave a lot to be desired and should go to charm school! We were a group of 34 and the man at the front desk, who said his name was Alessandro was the rudest person we ever met! In fact he would not give us his name. We had to depend on other staff to tell us who he was. We checked in 18 rooms and as group leaders asked why we had such a small room in the old part of the hotel. All the other rooms for our group were in the new part and you could dance in them! We were told they thought we were the guides! Anyway to make a long story short; they changed the room and lost our luggage! Eventually it was found in an even smaller room than the other , but when we went down to complain, Alessandro or Schemmo as the other staff called him, was again very rude. I was also with the travel agent who ran the trip and he spoke to her like trash. She books a lot of Rome, not a good move on his part. Eventually, the other guests said Schemmo also gave them a bad time! The hotel is very nice, the location great, but beware of the front desk!
UR6815724	Lynn UK - We have just returned from three days in Rome and had a fantastic time in this hotel. The staff were more than helpful and the food was good. Breakfast was a bit of a bun fight, but I think this is due to lack of staff, all in all a good hotel and would definitely use again.
UR6724609	Just returned from 3 nights in Rome and the hotel could not be in a better location. Walking distance to everything that you would want to see and on an extremely quiet and beautiful street. Rooms were small but that's expected. Clean and nice linens and towels. Bathroom had a great shower and lots of hot water. The problem was the front staff people were very indifferent...no concierge on duty to answer questions and when asked at the desk seemed to either not know what we were asking (english) or didn't seem to care. The breakfast was absolutely the worst buffet I have ever seen. And I have stayed in a lot of hotels and enjoyed breakfast. Runny eggs...greasy meats and hard pastries. The waiters looked annoyed to be asked for more coffee. We discovered a little cafe that had great ham and cheese sandwiches around the corner. Overall the hotel was good..paid for by the airline my husband works for so no complaints on price as we didn't pay.
UR6161721	We stayed here for 5 nights with a church group of 32 people from Virginia making a pilgrimage. Upon arrival, very few rooms were ready. We waited in the bar area for over 2 hours where the cocktails were overpriced and weak. No porter service was available. The rooms were small and in several cases dirty and moldy. Several in our group asked for new rooms but few were available. The food at the restaurant was marginal and expensive. Service was slow. A member of our group had her purse stolen off the back of her chair in the restaurant at breakfast. A priest with another group had his backpack stolen the same morning from a tour bus outside the hotel. There was no visable security until after these incidents. The hotel staff was not helpful with these problems at all. The hotel appears to be seriously understaffed and mismanaged. DO NOT STAY HERE!!
UR5931744	We stayed three nights on April 2006. The room was ok, standard, bathroom was nice. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. Friendly staff. Internet always available at 5 euros for half hour not bad. Huge lobby. In a residential location, close to the Vatican also. Five minutes from main avenue with lots of stores, gelatos, dept stores, grocerie shops, etc. Next time will try another location maybe.
UR5924948	We were quite surprised at how good this hotel was considering the reasonable price we paid. The front desk people were a little unfriendly, the concierege was ineffective in getting us restaurant reservations, and the bellman couldn't get us a taxi! Other than the personnel we really liked our room. It was modern and had two bathrooms (one was handicapped accesible). The breakfast buffet (included in the price) was the best we had at any of our hotels in Italy. The clientele was a mix of group tourists and business people. There were a few of us self directed tourists, but not many. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Vatican and there are several small restaurants in the immediate area to get a meal at.. It is about a 5 block walk to a Metro stop. I would stay at this hotel again.
UR5813055	Various tourist parties, typically Americans and Japanese, plus a couple of business conferences (one of which I was attending). Hotel was in nice quiet location, but easily walkable to the scenic areas of the city. Breakfast and lunch were fine: admittedly the bar prices appeared bit steep (but there are plenty of alternatives within a few minutes walk). Room was fine, comfortable bed and well-appointed bathroom with good water pressure. Only one minor problem, the small slow lifts. Nevertheless a good hotel, in which I would be happy to stay again.
UR5394473	We just got back from a week's stay at this lovely hotel. Our reasonable price included a buffet breakfast. The rooms were clean and modern, but small. Located just a few blocks from the Vatican, subway stop, restaurants. Quiet neighborhood. The staff was friendly, spoke English, tried to be helpful with restaurant and sightseeing suggestions. Very warm everyday. You must ask for ice cubes and cool drinks at Roman restaurants.
UR5047446	I stayed only 1 night on Business, so did not experience much of the hotel. Atmosphere is kind of dark and shabby, especially for a 4 star rating. Room was very large and two floors with a loft. No view but all amenities were good. Toiletries were privided and amble towels, toilet paper, etc. View was not good. Price was only 155 Euro with Breakfast. (however this was a corporate rate via my company, so regulary rates are probably much higher. Breakfast was average but had scrambled eggs, ham and capucino which was fairly good. Hotel was very busy with lots of tourists bustling about and help was not in a very relaxed mood or all that friendly, but were not rude. Hotel is close to center, so taxi ride was inexpensive. All in all, not a bad hotel, but not great either. I can say I had no problems, but it was only one night....
UR5022271	I travel to Rome on business and leisure at least twice a year and I've stayed at plenty of hotels. This is one of the better options for seveal reasons: - As with all Jolly hotels that I've seen, the rooms are pretty well-equipped and set-out. I was in a modern room at this hotel, and it was a little small, but well-appointed. - I found a good internet deal - which made this hotel a good option (some prices I've seen make it over-expensive) - beware and shop around! - The breakfast was pretty good, and the dining area is comfortable and spacious - a real bonus in Roman hotels. - Although the staff were not too friendly, they were efficient enough. - The hotel car to the airport was impressive - well worth the money (including an unscheduled detour down the Appian Way). - The location is a particular bonus: the centre is easily accessible by foot, as is the Vatican and the Centro Storico (Southwards through Prati). Moreover, the area around the hotel is one of the most pleasant parts of residential-central Rome. It is very quiet and very safe, yet there are very good shops, restaurants and bars all around, and good transport connections too. If you want to be facing the Pantheon etc, this is not your place, but if you like feeling like you're living amidst the Romans, then this is a good option. - If arriving at Ciampino, beware that a taxi driver may be reluctant to take you to the other side of town (as they'd see it)...but ask persistently and you should be OK...
UR4739258	Be warned that this hotel has very very different standard rooms. We were a family of 4 with 2 double rooms booked. On arrival the first rooms offered were on the 8th floor, turn to the right after leaving lift. These rooms were your worst nightmare, smelly dirty and dusty. Hotel agreed to move us without discussion but we were then put on the 2nd floor on the opposite side of the hotel, the children enjoyed the experience of camp beds- not! The rooms were cramped with faded and torn wall paper but the hotel informed us that this was all they had for a couple of days so little option. After 3 nights the hotel agreed to move us again, better rooms only the building work next door to our room, within the hotel, started at 7.30 a.m. Our room also managed to flood under the window. Overall the impression was a staff going through the motions with little interest, and certainly no friendliness, to its clients The only plus was that they responded to our written complaint with an offer of 2 night free in anther of their hotels.
UR4148174	Just returned from a four night stay at the Leonardo Da Vinci with a group of 34 - 27 high school age boys included in that number. Also, I have sayed at the hotel four times in the past with my student groups. I can honestly say that the hotel staff has always been helpful and accommodating to us. The place is clean and the location is fine, especially for large groups and families. The neighborhood is excellent with great shopping and restaurants nearby. It is about a twenty minute walk to the Vatican, Piazza Navona, and my favorite place, Campo di Fiori. We had a little problem confriming our bus to the airport this past trip and the hotel staff spent two hours attempting to resolve the situation. When there was no response from the bus company, they managed to get me another bus the night before we departed and the big workers' strike. Thank God for Rosanna and Franco, especially - they were wonderful in arranging for our departure (and I had to force them to take a small token of our appreciation). I return each year to Rome and we will definitely go back to the Jolly again. Take a chance - it's a great place to stay in Rome!
UR4024647	Upon check in at the hotel and with the confirmation email/guaranteed rate of Euro 144 in hand, Mr. Franco Caminati proceeded to charge us Euro 192! It took over a hour of negotiation and heated discussion to get the agreed upon rate. The rooms were small, but clean, the breakfasts satisfactory. We had rooms in the newer section so the a/c worked fine; the price of drinks in the bar were higher than the general area. The location was excellent in proximity to the Vatican. Overall the staff is not particularly friendly or accommodating.
UR3768765	With average room prices from 150€ to 200€ the "Leanordo da Vinci" isn't a low budget accomodation. In many other cities you will get much more value for the same price. Rooms are clean, nicely decorated, but relatively small. Breakfast buffet is okay, but you'll have difficulties to drink a beer at the bar after 23h. The personal (with exceptions) is not too friendly and reception staff usually looks like being molested by any question you will ask them. The biggest plus of the hotel is it's location: It is situated in "Prati", an upscale residential area west of the river Tiber, en route to Vatican city. The hotel lies in a quiet side road and you'll find many restaurants which are frequented by Romans and not so much by tourist crowds. It's three or four stops to city center by subway, half an hour by foot. If you are not too dependent on absolute gentleness of the personal and assumed that you have a big wallet, i would definitely recommend this hotel.
UR3617372	I have just spent a long weekend in Rome and stayed at the Jolly Hotel Leonardo Da Vinci. All in all, it was a pleasant hotel, nice and clean, friendly staff who could do no more to help with anything. To be honest the in-house prices for food and drink was overpriced, 10.50euro for a gin and tonic is outrageous when you can buy a bottle of Veuve Clicqoet champagne for 50euro! Great location, 10 minute walk to the Vatican, St. Peters Square, 5 minutes from the Metro handy for those longer destinations like the Coliseum. All in all it is your typical hotel chain experience, no real personal touch, just clean and efficient, but at the end of the day you're there to see the sights. not stare at your wallpaper, would not stay again, but purely as there are plenty of other hotels in different districts to experience. Thank you
UR3437916	My husband and I have just returned from a multi country vacation in which we ended our trip with a stay at the Jolly Hotel Leonardo Di Vinci in Rome. It is rated 4 star but does not deserve the rating. We have spent much time in Rome over the years and love the pride and professionalism that is displayed in hotel service and this hotel is the first NOT to display one iota of of this pride. We arrived with a small group about 10:30 am having had reservations for weeks. We were not greeted by anyone at the front desk as they were too busy talking and visiting with one another. We were put into a small waiting room off the lobby and informed someone would come for us shortly to register us. It took more than two hours and finally getting rude and pushy (while watching many other parties being cked. in and shown to rooms) to get us into rooms. There is no conc. service to help with rent cars, event tickets, directions or even anyone who knew what was going on in the city we might want to attend or see. One desk employee told us that the next day was a national holiday and everything in the country would be closed, another desk emp. told us that no, no, everything would be open anyway. Another desk emp. didn't know that Italy was having a national holiday. They could offer no advice on shopping at all in the new malls. Upon check out day, bell captain line was busy all am--had to carry our own bags. Also no one outside to hail taxis--had to stand in line at desk and ask for someone to call for us. Really not a place for anyone who expects anything more than a room with a bed--just a freeway motel type of experience.
UR3403313	Travelled with Perillo Tours and this is where they put us. BAD impression of the tour for the start of a great vacation. Hotel was convenient to ATM, bus and cab. Main street is a short walk away. Rooms were old and VERY hot! NO AC even though they said it was on!
UR3400851	I had some misgivings about this hotel after reading some of the other reviews! However, I found it to be a good place to stay. The staff are very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. The room is a little on the small side, but perfectly OK, has the usual amenities TV, minibar etc. Only gripe- the pillows are rock hard! We did ask for more pillows, which arrived promptly and much better. Bathroom is OK, the shower works well, unlike some weedy examples I've come across. Breakfast is good, buffet style with plenty of choice. We did dine in the resturant one evening. Would give this a miss, its overpriced and the food is not that great. Lone travellers need to be aware that this hotel is on a tree lined street and the street lighting is not that great. It felt safe, but I'd be cautious. I used a 'airport connections' to get there from the airport and they worked well
UR3369596	The Jolly Leonardo is located in a quiet area, with a few embassies around. It is quite centrally located, only 5 min walk to the metro station and approx 10 min to the city. It has lots of little cafe's around and a wonderful tiny pizza takeaway(it was really value for money and the pizza wasnt bad at all) Its safe to walk home at night and didnt have any trouble with traffic noises as the hotel is a good 100m from the main road. The room- i expected the room to be better, mind you be aware that when you book the standard room is the 'older' part of the hotel. The hotel is divided into 2 section on each floor where there are the refurbished rooms and the older rooms. The photos on expedia i gather would be from the refurbished rooms. To be fair the room is decent a wee bit outdated but nevertheless still comfortable and fair sized. The bathroom was clean-usual hotel style bathroom no less no more. Breakfast however was excellent!! there is a wide range of cold cuts, cheese and breads. Service was prompt and fair, and as its a 4-star hotel the breakfast run till around 10am. I had a choice i would probably skip this hotel and look for another one
UR3212578	Just got back from a great weekend in Rome celebrating my 40th birthday. Got a great deal on the hotel - everyone pretty helpful, paid $100 per night and had a great time. By no means the greatest hotel on earth but a pleasant surprise given some of the previous reviews - and would stay there again when we go back.
UR3186888	We spent one weekend in this hotel which is quite to very centrally located for the sight-seeing tourist. The room is very nice, even though the sanitary equipment looks a bit oldish. All necessary comfort is provided including a nice choice of bathroom articles. The breakfast buffet is quite big. One should go there relatively early, however, as not everything is refilled after having been taken away. We had one dinner in the restaurant. Service and food quality were much above average and good value for the money. All in all, the hotel is very good value for the money (we had a special rate of just € 110.-- for bed and breakfast, all inclusive) given its four stars which it certainly deserves. We will certainly stay there again, when we come to Rome next time. Two small caveats: If you are in a hurry, do not take the elevaters which can take long time to wait for. Secondly, make sure that your English spoken requests or orders are properly understood, as not everybody at the reception desk seems to be very good at English.
UR2589287	We stayed at the Jolly for 4 nights in September 04.We were not able to get rooms on the same floor as our friends and our room was very small and smelt smokey.The bed was large and comfortable but the bathrom was also very small although the shower was powerfull and the water always hot. We had booked a superior double so I dread to think how small a standard room would have been.The location was good, not too far to walk to the main attractions and the area quiet.The breakfast was O.K. but nothing out of the ordinary. we did`nt used the restaurant in the evening after having seen the pices of the drinks. The safe in both our room and our friends actually worked so we were able to lock away our toothbrushes (see prevoious posting )If i had to use one word to describe this hotel it would be " satisfactory "
UR2112792	I stayed at this hotel last week and encountered several problems....first I asked for a twin bed room and they booked me and my sister in a double room....they did eventually put us in a twin room after complaining! Second....they kept ringing our room asking and when I replied, to their questions they hung up....this happened four times!!! Third...We were in a smoking room and the smoke alarm went off and an engineer came into our room and found nothing wrong and starting moaning...forth....it was 10pm and I asked the receptionist if she could book a taxi to visit a friend and she looked at us and said "TAXI?? AT THIS TIME??" Finally, when we checked out, they tried to charge us for drinks from the mini bar which we didn't use....I found the hotel staff really rude and unwilling to help except for two! The room were nice and it wasn't so far from the major tourist sites...however, they could improve the bathrooms!!!
UR1832543	We stayed at this hotel from April 9th to 19th (we had prepaid for 10 nights). First, there was not enough space in the room to open 2 large suitcases. Second, the in-room safe didn't work -- the front desk said that was normal and that they didn't work in any of the rooms (despite this being listed as a hotel feature). On Easter Sunday, housekeeping used at least one of our toothbrushes to clean the drain (which we had left sticking out of the shaving kits on the sink to dry), i.e. the plastic was all scraped up and it was previously a brand new toothbrush. This was in spite of leaving a tip for the maid (of course this was the last one). The hotel manager said it was our word against housekeepings so nobody was going to get fired, but he did give us his apologies and a bottle of champagne (if we could we would have walked out after this 2nd night but we had prepaid and it was nonrefundable). Next, the rooms have no shower curtains so water gets all over the floor. Finally, on checkout, we were asked to pay for 2 bottles of water (7.5 Euros) when we hadn't consumed anything at all from the wet bar. The location was pretty convenient to a Metro station, the bed was comfortable enough, and the drains are pretty clean from all the toothbrushing, but we wouldn't stay there again.
UR1808971	My daughter was studying in Italy and the hotel was in a good location to her apartment. Unfortunately I had my camera stolen out of my room while at dinner. Incidents like that happen I understand, but the staff was not very helpful in assisting me in filing a report, or even where I was to go. It wasn't until my husband called them from the states and became irate that I got any kind of service. I hate being the squeaky wheel but even in Rome that's the only thing that works.
UR128327733	fantastic stay at the hotel clodio a very warm and friendly hotel the staff were excellent, especially Carmine who give us some great tips. a good choice was on offer for breakfast lots of pastries and if you asked the waitress they would bring you a capachino ,I would recommend this hotel for anyone who likes to walk as it is a 20minutes from the vatican walls .
UR127280487	Good distance from the center, near to public transportation and walkable distance to center, even with baby buggy.. Personnel outstanding, definitions of cleanliness vary depending on who is on duty. I would definitely stay here again, we have the suite though, which is pretty newly remodeled.. Don't know about the rooms.
UR123938045	I was staying at the Hotel Clodio for a long weekend and after asking for a nice room at the reception, i was assigned to what i was told being a newly furnished room. The room was very spacious, and with some nice amenities like Nespresso coffee etc. The bathroom was very nice as well as the terrace. I was travelling with my partner and we enjoyed every moment of our stay. The breakfast was also totally satisfactory
UR122250328	If you need to rest your head this is an average hotel. Nothing fancy about it at all. Elevators are slow and SMALL so no more than 2 people w/luggage at a time... no luggage you can fit 4. Thats about on this hotel. The breakfast was very good and a good assortment of pastries, beverages and even had bacon and eggs.
UR120068164	I stayed in Hotel Clodio in the first weekend of October 2011 for work. The hotel is located just below the “Montemario” hill near the headquarters of RAI. The hotel is officially a 4 stars hotel but when you get out of the elevator I can’t find immediately my room …. My room hasn’t have the door as the others rooms because it was in renovation … so I check all the other room numbers to be sure that the horrible door was effectively my door room. The room is quite spacious but the furniture is old and you have the sensation that all the furniture would be renovated and not only the door!! The hotel has a nice terrace on the roof which is divided in 2 parts: on the left side you have nice sofa and low table, on the right side there are some tables and the chairs very old!! Please renovate all the terrace!! The terrace is just below the “Montemario” hill and you can see a nice view!! The breakfast in nice with a lot of good food where you can meet some Italian TV famous people. The hotel is not a 4 star hotel without a renovation in the rooms!!
UR118593227	I had the chance to stay at the Clodio hotel in Rome in September, 2011. The hotel is located in a residential area about 1.7km directly north of the Vatican. The hotel is frequented primarily by Italians and there were very few non-Italian tourists at the hotel. The hotel is on a quiet side street and has a very unassuming front to it. The staff is quite friendly and speak English perfectly (probably other languages too). There are two different sized rooms available that I am aware of. I stayed in quite a large room that had a couch and a very large private patio overlooking the street. The rooms are very clean and well appointed in a typical European manner. Internet WIFI is available from the hotel for 4 Euro/day. They have a very good continental style breakfast that includes many breads, pastries, cold meats, fruit as well as scrambled eggs and ham. I am not sure if they have a full restaurant as I never checked it out. They do have a rooftop patio. There is a breakout/conference room for groups up to 20 or 30 on the main level. There is also a bar that opens around 7PM on the main level. There is lots of couches and seating space just off of the lobby. As far as location, it is not the most convenient to the main tourist attractions (except the Vatican). The Vatican is approximately a 20 minute walk away. Otherwise the Coliseum is over an hour walk (about 5.2km). A taxi ride is approximately 12-15 Euros to the gates of the Coliseum. This walking will have to be your fitness regime as there is no fitness centre that I am aware of in the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to avoid touristy hotels. Ask for room 110 if you can get it, it is worth it.
UR56801617	Was really impressed with the rooms and service at the hotel. It is located in close proximity with many of the landmarks in Rome. The staff is very curtious, helpful and very knowledgable. Loved the breakfast to start the day off on the right foot. It was one of my favorite hotels during our European excursion. I recommend the room with the balcony so that you can take in the beauty of Rome.
UR45901585	I was miserable during my stay at this hotel. After walking around in the humidity of Rome, I often found it warmer once I got to my room. You could hear the air conditioning, but nothing came out. Several of my girlfriends also said their rooms weren't air conditioned. I was finally moved to a room with air conditioning, but it was at the end of my stay. The location is good, but save your money for a hotel with working amenities.
UR124612277	I stayed in Ruskin Hotel for 35 days. I was very happy in Hotel survices. Nice breakfast, clean room, clean toilet and fast wirless connection.The location is close to many trian stations and easily accessible. The staffs were very helpfull. I am confident enought to advise my friends and other travellers to visit Ruskin hotel when they come to London. Nice to join again. fekadu
UR124346928	I recently stayed in this hotel for one night. It did get me out of a tight spot and it was cheap. I will say that the hotel has three saving graces; the location, the price and the staff. We managed about 4 +/- hours sleep between the hours of approx one and just after 5, being woken by noise from other guests, who sounded like they were in the same room, but with the dubious "benefit" of amplification from the halls. My daughter opened a drawer and it fell apart. I wouldn't let her walk on the carpet without shoes on, as it was filthy and worn through to the underlay, and then beyond in some places. Fluorescent lighting. We shared facilities and the shower room seemed new and was one of the better aspects of the stay. The toilet room was also new but the toilet was not clean. The evacuation map on the back of the door did not seem to match the floor layout. The breakfast was served in the basement, it was ok, the service staff were very pleasant, but it was not really enough to make up for the room. The location for getting around and seeing London was fantastic.
UR120798026	We only stayed at this B&B as we needed to put our heads down for a couple of hours before a very early start.Good points - Could check in very late, we left at 4am but we were able to leave our luggage till 9pm which was great. The communal toilets were very clean. The staff were incredibly helpful. The location is great right next to the British Museum. Bad points - the room was very dated and smelt musty, it felt that it needed a really good clean. The thing that disgusted us most was that when we arrived a call girl arrived at the same time being summoned up to a room by a business man. This put us off straight away and we were so thankful that we were only staying for a few hours, I deffinately would not recommend this place to families. Go if you need somewhere very cheap to stay in London and you know you will only be spending very little hours at the hotel.
UR117095213	As a group of three young women staying in London for a week, the Ruskin worked wonderfully. The location was fabulous, within short distance of four tube stops, and was literally a stone's throw away from the British Museum. The hotel staff was very friendly, and was always willing to help us out by giving us directions, maps, or restaurant recommendations. Breakfast was slightly limited, but very good. Room decor was dated and left something to be desired, and the bathroom down the hall wasn't our ideal situation, but we had no problem with the arrangement. Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to London!
UR115099997	First, the good news: The Ruskin's location is unbeatable, literally within the shadow of the British Museum. The staff is also very helpful, cheery, & attentive. The shower always had hot water, the water pressure was great, & the entire hotel was clean. Here are the tradeoffs: The rooms are quite small, the shower down the hall is miniscule (30 x 30") & has only a hook for your clothes, shampoo, etc.; the walls of the rooms are quite thin, & the wardrobe in the room was inadequate for 3 adults. It was like staying in a travel trailer for a lot more money.
UR114978111	I think this hotels best advantage is the location. In comparison to other locations such as Bayswater, Paddington or Sussex Gardens I found it a little bit overpriced.But then again, I didn't spend a lot of money on taxi's or buses, I could easily walk home after visiting theatres or restaurants in the West End. Everything was OK, it was clean and the staff was very friendly, but yet, it was more of a very simple B&B than a hotel which you might think when you see the price. My biggest question mark is about the breakfast, even though it was a bit amuseing to watch the very cumbersome ritual, when you finally get the breakfast it's as everything else with this hotel, it's OK. Having said all this, I can easily recommend Ruskin Hotel to everyone, just bear in mind that it's a simple B&B which you pay a little bit to much for, but maybe save taxifares on.
UR114003550	wanted to stay in this hotel for 4 nights in the end of june before my trip to edinburgh and for another 3 nights direct in the beginning of july. in between these two stays would have been just a 5-days intervall, where i would have been in edinbirgh. at first both of my booking have been confirmed. later the hotel turned up with a minimum saty of 5 days for my first booking. either i should stay another night or just pay another night. i contacted the hotel twice to agree about some solution, since i had booked all my transfers accordingly. but despite the fact i had a all in all confirmed 7-days booking and offered to pay everything in advance there was no way. they insisted on a 5-nights minimum stay or i would need to cancel. very greedy and unflexible
UR108825135	This place is relatively inexpensive for London, but is still way overpriced for the barely-clean, uncomfortable room; strange shared toilet with no sink; shared shower with perpetually wet floor; and indifferent breakfast. Lovely location right by the British Museum, though. It would make a not-very-nice hostel for half the money.
UR101987425	When on a budget in London, you can expect either bad service, questionable rooms or an unfortunate location. Ruskin has none of these. Actually, the staff is very helpful, rooms are clean and the street is quiet yet in the centre of London. Sure, the furniture is old and the floors are squeaky. But a table-served full English breakfast, 24 hour check-in, helpful staff and fairly comfortable rooms can't be beat easily for this price. Shower was nice and hot, wifi in lobby only but free.
UR99616875	Advantages: * Cheap * Good location * Clean * Comfortable * Shared shower and lavatory conveniently located and clean Disadvantages: * Very small * Rather hot - needed to have window wide open to compensate for over-zealous heating * Very noisy outside
UR92072244	Ideal location, you can walk to all the sites. Theatres all walkable. 1960 basic style hotel but clean, friendly staff. Juice,Cereal, Toast, Hot Cooked Breakfast, Tea or Coffee. Room for 3, £80 nt, B/B Excellent value!!
UR90669133	The hotel was very clean, the location was great & the staff were friendly & helpful. The hotel is old and the rooms are small, but in Europe most rooms are small. We had a triple room with private bath. The room had one double bed & one single. The breakfast was good. If you want a hotel that is cheap with great location this is a good place to stay. If you want a nicer hotel with all the amenities you will need to spend more on the hotel.
UR90605731	cheap, clean, friendly staff and a really central location, this is top value
UR90088241	The Good: I paid 59 pounds for a single room with shared shower and toilet. My room had a single bed, a built in desk with a mirror above it, a sink with a mirror, and a freestanding wardrobe/closet. There was a radiator plus an electric heater ("gas heater" they told me it was called?). There were two outlets in the room, plus one for a shaver. Breakfast was included in the rate, and consisted of a fried egg, beans, ham, a sausage, toast, coffee or tea, PLUS you could help yourself to any of four different cereals and milk, and several kinds of juice. The location was incredible, right next to the British Museum. (Literally: you step out the door of the hotel and you were looking at the side of the museum. You could walk to the front entrance in about 3 minutes.) The room and all the facilities, while a little old (shabby, some might say) were spotlessly, sparklingly clean. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner place. Also, it was very quiet. I only ever saw another guest in the lounge or at breakfast. Never heard others in the hallway, never had to wait for a toilet or shower. The room and all the facilities, while a little old (shabby, some might say) were spotlessly, sparklingly clean. The tiles in the sink-surround area literally sparkled, which is pretty amazing because they seemed to be pretty old. The toilet and the shower always smelled vaguely like bleach, which, frankly, I found reassuring. I couldn't have asked for a cleaner place. That's the good. The Bad: The shower was very tiny. I'm a 5'2" women of medium build. The shower was approximately 30"x30". Shaving my legs was tricky. Also, there is no shelf or ledge or anything to set your soap or shampoo on. I did feel a little funny about setting my soap on the floor of the shower and then, say, washing my face with it. The little vestibule outside the shower was exactly the same size as the shower, and there was no bathmat. I was turned off by stepping on the wet floor after my shower. I would stay again, but I would bring a suction-cup soap dish, and a cheap bathmat (with the plan to throw them out/ leave upon my departure). The Not Bad but Sort of Nit-Picky: The outlet situation was tough. There was no outlet anywhere near either mirror, and the cord on my tiny travel hair dryer was too short to use. I asked the front desk clerk where I could buy an extension cord, and though he tried to help, he couldn't really describe anywhere that I would easily be able to get to. Once he understood the problem, however, he loaned me a framed mirror that I hung on the handles of the wardrobe. It worked out well, and I was pleased with his willingness to help. A few other things: they seem to be very very strict about the check-in time. From the lounge I heard them tell a handful of inquiring guests that their rooms would not be ready until 2pm. Period. No offer to "let me see what I can do," or anything like that. 2 pm, end of story (which is fine, and fair, but many hotels will try to squeeze you in. From what I overheard it seems to be a pretty firm policy at the Ruskin). Other reviewers complained about the decor. Yes, the walls were pink, the tiles around the sink were yellow, the bedspread was gold, the carpet was mauve, the curtains were blue, and the wood on the desk, chair and closet were all different. Really? You come to London to see things that are hundreds of years old, and complain because the furniture in your hotel is a bit shabby? How someone could pay so little and get such a great location, and yet have the nerve to complain about the decor is totally beyond my comprehension. If you want precisely the same comforts of home, here's a tip: don't leave home. I liked the hotel and wuold absolutely stay again. Overall, I was very pleased. I would stay again, but I would do some things differently. 1) bring a cheap bathmat, plan to leave it/throw it away when you leave. The share
UR87748397	Really a good location, next to the British Museum and buses and underground. A clean friendly little hotel, very quiet and very good value. It would not appeal to people who want TVs and modern bathrooms and the amenities of a regular American hotel. There is a kettle in the bedroom with tea and instant coffee supplied. Breakfast in included in the price. I have stayed here several times and will return again.
UR86387371	I liked the hotel Ruskin, granted it's not swanky but it served it's purpose. The location is great, the price was amazing and granted to room was small but what more do you need? I wasn't planing on staying in my room on my visit to London. The sheets were clean and the bed was comfy. I was right next to the British Museum, how can you beat that for 59 pounds a nite? I didn't get a chance to make it to breakfast but I did wander down to the breakfast room, it was nice. Clean and cute. I felt very safe in the hotel and I'm a single female traveler, not once did I feel scared. The bathroom sharing thing was a new experience to me but I didn't mind. I had no trouble getting in when I needed to use the facilities and it was very clean. As in any place you take a public shower, you just wear some flip flops, no big deal. I would stay there again on my next trip to London.
UR84538776	At the price of £59 for a single room it is difficult to beat in Central London - not far from Oxford St/British Museum. The room was tiny and the shared bathroom/toilet is not ideal, but the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was good and very quick. In essence you get what you pay for, as long as you don't expect the Ritz then you won't be disappointed.
UR82209488	London is a very expensive place to stay; so I consider it a bargain to be able to find a "clean enough" hotel for under $120 a night for two, including a full English breakfast. If a traveler is looking for a hotel of the caliber of, say, the average Holiday Inn in the US, this is not the place for him. We decided to request a room with the shared toilet and shower (in the hallway to save a little money). Here are the positives: 1. The hotel has a lift (elelvator), which many hotels in Europe don't have. This means I don't have to schelp my luggage up and down stairs. 2. The rooms, though very small, are reasonably clean, with fresh towels and your beds made up every day. 3. A delicious full English breakfast is included in the price, with as many eggs, sausages, toast, and cereal as you'd like. 4. The hotel is right across the street from the British Museum, and easily walkable to the Russell Square and Hoburn tube stops (both on Piccadilly line, which takes you directly to Heathrow). 5. There is, in fact, free WiFi, but only on the first floor where the sizeable lounge is located. 6. The staff at the desk was always polite and helpful to us. 7. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, and safe, and there are numerous restaurants within an easy walking distance. 8. The hotel is small enough that we never had to wait to use the toilet or shower. 9. The sheets and bedding were clean. 10. We slept quite well. Here are the negatives: 1. the furniture is shabby to be sure, 2. the shared baths/showers could use a fan and bath mats. 3. It would be nice if every room were WiFi equipped. We are the kind of travelers who don't spend a lot of time in the hotel room and don't need our own TV. In fact, we don't mind spending a little time with fellow travelers in the lounge. We prefer convenience to transportation and activities over beautiful accommodations. One traveler we met described his room as "funky" but even he agreed he'd return because of all the positives listed above. We would too.
UR80456293	I used ebooking to locate and book a hotel in London. Obviously I reviewed comments made by previous guests. To my dismay the comments were not true to life. Very small 5x10 dirty carpeted rooms. Furniture is of an age and style impossible to describe because I’ve never come across anything similar. Within the room itself there was zero comfort in fact I left my bag and went immediately to the internet café because the hotel offers no internet access. Outside the room you have the luxury or sharing the bathroom and shower with guests - which as you can imagine is a little odd when you run from your room half naked down the corridor to find the shower occupied. When you do finally get in the shower your greeted by a wet floor and 1 cubic meter of plastic shower cubical. And yes you guessed it “where did you hang the towel and place the shower gel” the mind boggles. The only half decent thing was the “Full” English breakfast served by an Italian and cooked by relic from the nearby history museum - it didn’t give me diarrhea
UR77026046	The furniture is old and torn, the carpet and sheet are dirty; Except the reception, the staff was rude. Ms. Esther van der Meer, the guest review manager from Booking.com emailed me an email but the website never released my review until now, so that's why the scores of guest reviews about the hotel could be so high. I should have stayed there for 6 days but it was so terrible and untolerable that I checked out three days later.
UR66492574	We stayed here for 3 nights and would recommend it for anyone on a budget. I wasn't too keen on the fact we didn't have an en-suite but there was no queueing for the toilet or separate shower which were clean bur rather small. The breakfast was self-serve cereal and then a cooked breakfast and toast. The friendly staff asked whether we wanted more tea and toast, nothing was too much trouble for them. Only on the last morning did we notice the "tip" basket as we went in.First time ever in the UK have we seen such a thing at a B&B. Needless to say didn't put anything in ! The guy at reception was very helpful with directions and looking things up on the internet for you. As others have said you can easily walk everywhere from here, we even walked to the London Eye. Note that none of the shops in Oxford St open until 10am so no point in setting off too early! We would definately return here if in London again.
UR65335188	had double room on top floor, double there means 2 singles. Long cell but very clean and neat and all i needed. nice view of garden and with no screens and the window all the way up cool breeze at night slept like a log. Room with tolit just to the left of my door and shower just to the right closer thean at home. there was a tub and tolit just down the hall but did not venture there. i am 6ft 2 and 250lb fit everywhere with no problem. I walked to Buckingham palace by way of Big Ben set on the steps of St Martins in the field then on to the palace took about an hr to make the stroll. Breakfest was fine and the staff nice but what the English call sausage and bacon is mighty slim to a southern boy. dont see how you could beat this location and this price, there are at least 2 hostels near by for the younger bunch one a little pricey right next door and a less expensive and very large one that my daughter and friends stayed at 2 blocks in front of the tube station
UR64466448	There are two reasons you would stay at the Ruskin: it's cheap and just across the street from the British Museum. We're not people who need luxurious accommodations. If we're comfortable and clean, we don't mind the furniture and decor that haven't been updated since the 1960's. But the mattresses were so bad, none of us slept well. I doubt there have been new mattresses in a couple of decades. At least. The Ruskin staff was polite and tried to be helpful, although they weren't familiar with their own neighborhood enough to give us directions to an automatic laundry or restaurants. The breakfast was much larger than I expected: eggs over easy, bacon, sausage, toast, cereal, juice, tea, coffee. It was more than enough to keep us going until a late lunch. There was excellent service. The shower on our floor was very small, and a large person would probably not fit in it. Although it was cleaned daily, if the person before you got the floor wet, there weren't adequate towels or bath matts to mop it up. I think the staff tries to do the best with what they have, but they have limited resources. I would pay the extra money and get a better place.
UR64177890	The hotel is a nice hotel with a good location. The breakfast was good, traditionel english breakfast. There is only limited wifi. DONT STAY HERE!!! ONLESS YOU GET A ROOM WITH PRIVATE BATH!!! The shared bath, was 1x1M cabin. Not a place for a place big man. But the worst part is the shared toilets! THERE IS NO SINK IN THEM. That is so discusting!!
UR58000982	Excellent location across the street from the British Museum. Good value for the economy traveler. Ideal place to leave your stuff and see London. If you plan to spend much time in your room you should stay somewhere else. No internet in room- internet in lounge works. No TV. Clean. Nice breakfast.
UR57859577	Booked this hotel on advice of Tripadvisors. I am very unpretentious but, sorry, I simply could not stay here. Somewhere in my readings it mentioned internet at this facility. Not true. Only a poor, sporadic WIFI signal. Signal is better in the lounge downstairs which closes at 11pm. Rooms do not have TV, but there is a TV in the lounge, which closes at 11pm. Old carpet. Undiffused fluorescent tube lighting. Comfortable bed. Room reeked of cleaning solution. Toilette clean but bring shower slippers. Management did give me a full refund. The staff was very friendly. At breakfast, which was nice but, alas, no yogurt, I met several people who were obviously fine with the accommodations. I, however, felt like a cloistered nun. For a mere 35 pounds more per night (plus 10 pounds per 24hr Internet usage = oh well) I lodged at the Grange Whitehall across the street and had a very lovely stay. One Tripadvisor said she stayed here for her honeymoon. What??!! Stay at The Dorchester.
UR50025918	It is a nice hotel for an acceptable price... Clean, the room was big enough. As a minus, the toilet and the shower which are on the corridor...but everything is really clean. Overall it is a good value for money.
UR49184256	The Ruskin is located in the vicinity of Russell Square, Bloomsbury, a stone throw from the British Museum, in a safe, clean and quiet neighborhood. Within walking distance of three underground stations which make use of the tube quite practical.There are also bus lines that run near by. It is centrally located which makes sightseeing a breeze. I walked to most places and used the tube on occassions. The reception staff is excellent: friendly, helpfull and informative. The staff is knowledgeable about the sights and the surrounding neighboorhoods. If you have a specific situation ask and they shall find out for you. The hotel has a contract with a local taxi company which provides service for the guest at reduced rates. I used that service twice during my stay and I recommend it . I had an early departure from Heathrow and had no clue as to which terminal I needed to check in. The reception inquired as to which terminal I was to depart from at Heathrow and arranged for a cab to pick me up at 5:00AM. The complementary English breakafast is excellent and the breakafast staff is very nice, friendly and polite.I had a single room (G24) with a lovely view of an English garden. The room was quiet and very clean.Confortable single bed and clean linen which was changed regularly ( I stayed 5 nights).Room has a sink inside with clean towels included. There is a space heater in the room and an electric tea pot. I had a shared bathroom which was located near by and kept clean at all times. There is a WIFI connection available if you have your own portable PC. I strongly recommend the Ruskin for someone looking for an affordable, friendly hotel in the heart of central London that satisfies the basic necessities. If you want luxury and frivolous frills the Ruskin is not your kind of place. I would definitely return to the Ruskin.
UR46800077	Our room, although small, was more than adequate. Clean and quiet. Shared toilets/showers was never a problem. Plenty of hot water and never a wait - even with a full hotel. The full English breakfast every morning was a real treat and served by pleasant staff. The desk staff was very helpful and extremely accommodating. We checked in very late after 2am and were allowed to leave our luggage for an entire day after checking out. Convenient location. I will definitely return to this hotel. Perfect for the traveler who is looking for a nice, clean, quiet, reasonable place to lay down after a full/day evening exploring London.
UR34300402	We stayed there 12 nights in May and found the hotel to be generally clean, well-run, and most of the staff was nice and accommodating. We had a basement room which was enormous. The trade off was street noise, but that isn't bad on Montague st. the room was no frills but did have a sink. The shared bathroom was always available, but it didn't drain well so that the floor was often wet after showers. Breakfast was fine English fare although the service was inconsistent. For us its location was ideal, but it is a little hike from the nearest tube station or most bus routes.
UR30868491	Stayed here as I booked late and it was the only hotle with rooms free for 5 nights , glad I did ! Nice clean rooms ,comfortable and tidy . The added bonus of breakfast in the price was good , and this was well cooked and served with a full English breakfast available plus juices cereals coffee or tea . The staff were lovely anf friendly . The location was excellent with the BritishMuseum litterally opposite and Oxford street less than 10 mins walk away , plus you are4 close to 2 tube stations . I would def return .The bathrooms are sgared but lovely and clean so taking night attire is a good idea . There is a lift which makes getting to the rooms easy and the value is excellent ( I paid 353 a night for a single ) . A great find .
UR24600687	Good clean hotel, very central. Room was small but clean and tidy. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. 10 mins walk from Covent Garden.
UR18080990	The Ruskin Hotel just might be the best deal in London, or at least in Bloomsbury. We've stayed there 3 times and have never been disappointed. True, the decor may be dated and the rooms rather small, but consider these positives: (1) the staff is very helpful and courteous, from the gentlemen at the front desk to the waitresses serving a very fine English breakfast; (2) the rooms facing relatively quiet Montague Street are sunny, bright, and scrupulously clean; (3) the location, facing the British Museum on an elegant-looking street, gives you access to three tube stations and lovely Russell Square is one block north. All in all, once we Americans set aside our expectations about private bathrooms (although these are available, too) and gigantic rooms and beds (and cable TV), it's a great place to stay while sightseeing in London. The Ruskin will leave you feeling you've been treated like a human being, for much less cost than swanker hotels.
UR17616923	My son and I stayed in a twin room for 5 nights (room 309) at the Ruskin. We were very busy seeing the sights and the hotel was an excellent jumping off point. Three Tube stops were nearby, and the entrance to the British Museum was literally around the corner. The hotel was well run, breakfast was excellent and quickly provided, and the staff was polite and visible, yet discrete. We came and went at our leisure, and the room was done well by the time we got back in the afternoon. Our twin room had only a sink, so we shared the bathrooms on the 3rd floor. Those were clean and available. We had absolutley no issue in that regard. My only complaint is the seemingly thin walls. The people next to us for one night were fairly loud, and the sound came right thorugh the wall like they were in our room. In summary, I would recommend this relatively modest but clean and orderly hotel. The price was right, and it was very clean and orderly in all key respects - perfect for our purposes.
UR12625660	This was my 2nd stay at the Ruskin. Attempted to book the same room, room 105, from the previous visit in October but was given a different room. For room 307, we paid £105 per night. Room had one double and one single bed. Ensuite bathroom was quite small. Although the room was clean and comfortable, the furniture is shabby. There were issues with hot water and water pressure. Not much hot water. Didn't bother to use cold water at times. Water pressure was quite low. Extra pillows and blankets were not available in the room. As with my previous visit, the staff was friendly and helpful. No issues with breakfast. Taxi cabs frequently drive by. So, there wasn't a need to call in advance for a taxi. At £105 per night, I wouldn't want to stay in room 307 since better quality rooms are available.
UR10052572	This hotel was unbelievably overpriced. We were looking for something cheaper but thought we would at least be staying in a decent hotel having paid that much when booking. It wasn't clear when booking that we would have to share a bathroom. There was one shower for the whole floor which was tiny and unclean. The room was old and lacking in facilities. The beds were very uncomfortable and the linen was very old. Breakfast was ok, but the staff were incompetent. On our last day they were too lazy to clean our table and never bothered taking our order. We had to leave having had no breakfast, as we ran out of time. They saw us get up and leave and didn't even apologise for the appaluing lack of service. This isn't a hotel, it is a glorified hostel.
UR7009622	The room was basic, but very clean and tidy. The staff very friendly. Breakfast was lovely and plenty of it. Its in a great location if visiting the theatres or shops. Would definately recommend and would stay there again if in the area.
UR127526859	This hotel is outside of venice but easy accessible by using the public buses when you get the hang of it!. The directions we were given werent very clear so it took us a couple of hours to find it so i definately recommend booking the airport transfer with the hotel before you go. The hotel staff were friendly enough and room was fine if a little dusty but the price was so reasonable and for a room like we had we would of paid triple the price inside venice! It would of been nice for the hotel to of had somethign going on like a dining room or music in the evening.
UR124798233	The weather in Venice was unusually cold when we arrived. We went up to our room and found it cold and the heat was off. There was only a sheet and a thin blanket on the bed (no bedspread), so I went downstairs to ask for some more blankets. After much discussion with the others behind the counter, the woman emphasized I could only have ONE blanket because they would not have enough blankets for everyone if all the rooms asked for more. We had a queen size bed and the extra blanket they gave us was for a twin bed. We turned on the heater and went out for a few hours, when we returned, the room was still freezing cold! After fiddling with the thermostat some more and then talking to the front desk, we found out that it was wired backwards and you had to set it to "cooling" to get the heat to come on. Really? It took until morning to get the room up to a comfortable temperature. Hoping for a shower to warm up in was another big disappointment. The water pressure was okay, but the temperature was barely warm enough to be comfortable. I'm not looking for a scalding hot shower, but the mirror didn't even steam up in the bathroom if that tells you anything. The towels were skimpy and somewhat resembled table linens (maybe they were). The bathroom could use a good scrub and the shower tiles were black with mildew. The ceiling in the bedroom had black mildew as well. The toilet didn't always flush. The shower door fell off when I opened it. The in-room fridge and safe did not work, and the chair, while pretty, was about to fall apart and unsafe to sit in. At a quick glance, the place looked very elegant, but it really was very tired and not well maintained. The people running it don't really seem to care. They claim to be a "3 star" hotel, but that is a joke. Stay away from this place.
UR124346466	Unpleasant stuff and overpriced dirty and hard to find hotel. 44 E for a room "without the breakfast of course"- as reception desk girl said. It's with tax (on the website tax is nor included). Breakfast 3 E per person and wi-fi 7 E for 24 hours (witch is a bit ridiculous now when the wi-fi is free even when you drink a coffee somewhere). First room we received had broken light in bathroom and plus for the reception girl- she realized it herself and gave us another room, so we moved. In next room the remote control was broke so we realized that something has to be broken ;) Although we thought in first moment that perhaps you have to pay additional fee for it ;D Room definitely needs renovation especially the bathroom cause the paint was falling down from the wall. Water under the shower was "almost almost warm". In this price at least warm water should be a standard! Room wasn't exactly clean so I don't recommend the hotel. For sure you can have something better in this price.
UR124075449	The hotel discription of location is VERY misleading! We had to take a cab from the train station to the hotel 28Euro! Then the statement about shuttle services forgets to spell out restricted times and how much it costs to take the shuttle outside those times! Our room was DISGUSTING! A hole in the wall, broken toilet seat, torn pillows, the list goes on! We had to stay one night because they REFUSED to refund our money! The woman behind the counter kept saying she could not refund us because we did not cancel 2 weeks before check in date....I told her 2 weeks before check in date I believed their false advertising and didn't find out how horrible the place truly was unitl we got there! I could not handle a 2nd night in that dump, so we went into Venice and stayed at the Best Western right across the street from the train station! ****The Best Western Hotel Bolgna was very accommodating, clean, safe and great breakfast!
UR120107617	First of all it took me just over 2hours to find the hotel from the airport as I went for the public transport option probably my fault but i didnâ€™t expect the hotel to be in the middle of nowhere. After travelling for such a long time I was greeted by a cold and rude receptionist, who shrugged her shoulder and said I should have paid for the shuttle bus from the airport after I told her how long it had taken me to find the place and then pointed me in the direction of my room, the room was another shock it smelled and looked old, when I booked it I was told the room will have a mini-bar and a safe first of all the fridge wasnâ€™t working and the safe was broken, I went and told the receptionist who acted like I was disturbing her and told me there was nothing they could do as I went to walk off back to my room she said that I could use their safe behind the desk. I was woken up every morning just after 7am as I noticed my room was next door to the laundry room. i almost cried from the lack of sleep i got there, It was very noisy at night because it was such a old building I could hear the guests upstairs from my room using the toilet. Nothing was good about Hotel Villa Dori as you've probably gathered I did NOT enjoy stay there and would not recommend it. If Venice wasnâ€™t such a beautiful place this hotel could seriously ruin your holiday.
UR119705369	This could be a nice hotel, if only... many things were different. First of all staff were not helpful at all, neither arranging a group booking for 18 nor when we stayed at the hotel! At times the were outright rude! I never before experienced a receptionist telling a travel agency to f... off and book on the Internet, when they wanted to place a group booking, what obviously happened here and our experience while staying there was not much different. The hotel is in lovely rural surroundings which may provide a pleasant contrast to buzzing Venice during high season. In late October we did not notice any unpleasant smells from the nearby canal as other reviews stated but the rooms on the ground floor clearly have a mould problem and I preferred to have the window wide open in spite of chilly night temperatures. Other than that many of the rooms are nicely decorated and sufficiently spacious- however not as nicely as shown on the Internet. The public transport to Venice is by no means as good as described on the Internet and their shuttle bus requires 24 hours notice if you want to be sure to get on. The breakfast for 6 Euros offered a variety of choices although some seemed a bit strange for breakfast, which however is down to personal taste. There was sufficient of everything at 8 am when we had our breakfast. I would not specifically want to recommend this hotel due to the points described but if someone was dependent on cheap accommodation in the vicinity of Venice it is one option as long as you make sure you avoid the ground floor rooms with the mould problem and know sufficient Italian to return any rude comments straight away.
UR119142002	This is a lovely small hotel - don't let the staff put you off!! The bus journey into Piazza Roma is about 20-25mins. The bus stop is a 5-7 min walk from the hotel. Going into venice the bus stop you want is next to the canal (the hotel don't tell you that) Once you have checked into the hotel they will give you a map of where they are and where you can buy bus tickets. If your stay is for a few days, calculate how many trips you are likely to want and buy a travel card from the tabacc - it works out at a little over one euro each way per person, which is 2 euros each way cheaper per person than the one ticket the hotel tell you to buy. You can use the hotel shuttle (for a charge, but you need to get in early to book!) and there are limited schedules to work with. We used the hotel shuttle service to collect us from the airport (because we didn't want to get lost). The hotel prices are different to what they advertise, so double check. Once you have found your feet in Venice it is easy to find your way back to the airport, cheap and very simple. It's the last stop ! You can also for a small fee leave your luggage at the train station if like us you have an evening/late afternoon flight.
UR119120988	If You're looking for a budgeted hotel, this is it! Nice, clean and affordable. We're traveller with two children. The shuttle was easy access to the city center (about 7 to 10 minutes). Public transportation was very close (bus stop at the corner of the hotel). My children had a good time with surrounding of the hotel. it was truly like a villa!
UR118317949	Stay far, far away from this place. May I say that's exactly where this hotel is... Far from Venice. This hotel came as a recommendation from a co-worker so, I gave it a shot. first off, this hotel is approx. 20 mins. from the City center via a shuttle that is by appointment only. The van can only fit so many people. The last van shuttle from Venice is at 10 pm. Secondly, the staff was not helpful at all. In fact, when I called to reschedule the van pick up at the airport due to a flight delay. The woman who answered the phone at the front desk explained to me that she was way too busy with other things to help me out. There was no other accommodation had so, I was forced to take the public bus to the train station of Mestre (which is the actual village location of the hotel), then to take a cab to the hotel which was roughly 25 euros. Finally, after having to reconfigure my ride to the hotel I arrived at the hotel to a very cold greeting by the staff. I was tired at this point and just wanted to get to my room. Before I was handed the 5 pound key that looks like it belonged to the Bates motel I was informed that there is "tourist tax" that is accrued by the hotel because of the "high season" . That was roughly 15 euros. Off to the room I go, the room was not bad but, there was a connected long patio with which to share with your neighbors and I quickly learned how thin the walls were. Fast forward to the next morning. I awake to eat breakfast which is 6 euros (not a bad spread, either). I asked to find an ATM and the woman, who I believed was the same voice who answered the night before she informed me that it was a 10 min walk away from the hotel. It was in fact 20 mins. With directions from the locals. There is no ATM in the hotel. There was also a man at the front dest who basically grunted at me when I asked him questions about the shuttle. He was the van driver. Btw, the van costs 3 euros to and fro to Venice. While waiting for the van to drop me off at the airport it was 15 mins. Late with no explanation and it was an appointed time. Also, keep in mind that if you're trying to get to the airport give yourself enough time to get there because the people to be dropped off in Venice have priority over your getting to the airport. Without saying, there were many van shuttle issues. This hotel was a great disappointment. I would save your money and pay a little extra to stay in the city center of Venice because the amount of money infringed upon you for trivialities at the place and rudeness of staff is not worth the budget offer it suggests online.
UR117314556	The room we were given had no window. Luckily there was another available. The staff did not speak fluently English, I had to use my very bad Italian. They were helpfull. The room did not look tidy, maybe this is what we could expect for the price we paid. The hotel should be renovated, or at least painted and refurnished. The furniture looks as it has been collected at garage sales. If you are on low budget this might be a good place to stay, but keep in mind you cannot allways get into the shuttle, and there are only 2 available. The morning times are fine, but evenings are late for couples with small children. Use of public transport to get to Venice is dissaster. A mosquito protection is a must.
UR117091748	So beautiful.......clean, rooms beautifully styled in typical Venice fashion. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The hotel is so well located. I could have stayed here forever.
UR117066817	Wouldn't been my first chocice of accomondation in Venice unless we hadn't been ravelling by car. I choose it as they had free parking, which is luxory in around venice and the prices were good for a family room. It's situated quite far from both Venice and Maestre and getting into town could be a bit tricky unless they wouldn't have had they own shuttle bus going into town in the morning coming back in the evening. The hotel is decorated in an old style although I don't think it was that old. The buffet breakfast was absolutely worth the extra 5 â‚¬. However, it's worth going there as soon as they open as the food run out and they didn't fill it up. They had an incredible good self-service Cappuccino automat that gave you the best coffee I've experienced. The back side of the place is the service. The young woman at the counter was the most unfriendly I met and she was constantly moaning as the customers were a burden for her. The attached restaurant can't either be recommended; bad service, over priced and we were served the worst (microwave) pizza ever. The extra tax added on your bill for the service made us feeling cheated.
UR107893482	The decor wa lovely. I enjoyed our stay. Would deffinately come back. Room was clean, staff was nice and the bed was comfortable. The only downside for me was location!
UR105528566	W can not find this Hotel easy, The area is very quit, on the web site this hotel better seems. The recepcionist not very friendly, I ask something and she was unpolite. The room was cleaned but very old fashion. (the cupboard made in 1800 years) I think this hotel is trendy for italian people. We stayed there one night only. We payed 44 euro/room and no breakfast. The breakfast is extra 4 euro / person. Internet 3 euro/30 minutes. But this hotel ok for 1 night.
UR104898980	If you want to spend fourt times as much to stay in Venice, a hotel on the mainland isn't for you. But if you want a hotel that is pretty, friendly, accommodating, quiet, pleasant, spotlessly clean, and inexpensive, the Villa Dori fills the bill. Two morning shuttles--at 9:30 and 10:30 a.m.--get you into Venice in about 20 minutes. You have the option of purchasing an ample breakfast at the hotel for 5 euros before you leave for Venice. The evening shuttles--at 9:00 and 11:00 p.m.--give most people plenty of time to do everything that is possible to do in one day in Venice before turning in for a restful night. Additionally, the shuttle willl take you to and from the airport and elsewhere for the cost of a modestly-priced taxi. You can also take two public buses (use your "Hello Venizia" card), which runs every half hour. We did that twice. If the buses don't connect exactly, you may have to wait up to a half hour for the connection, so plan on that eventuality. Both of the rooms we had were sunny and bright, recently painted and spotless. Some of the earlier reviews are possibly out of date, as the entire hotel seems to be newly renovated. The housekeeping staff is impeccable. The downstairs reception area is pleasand and inviting. The internet, which you can get very well in the open areas and less well in your room, costs 7 euros--which is about half the price of internet service in hotels in Venice. There is a vending machine full of snacks, hot and cold. The restaurant attached to the hotel, open only in the evening, adds to the desirability of taking the 9:00 shuttle "home" to a decently-priced supper. If you want to enjoy a leisurely meal in Venice, though, you might want to plan on the 11:00 shuttle. The best reason for staying on the mainland, other than price, is that you can explore the nearby estates and wine region and other places such as Padua (where St. Anthony is buried) and Ravenna (home of 5th century artifacts) and still be within reach of Venice. We enjoyed our stay immensely and almost felt sad to leave, as one does the home of a friend. --Visitors from New York and Pennsylvania.
UR98633665	We stayed here to visit the Venice Carnival in Feb 2011. We did not want to pay silly money in Venice itself so chose to stay here for a really good price. Yes, the hotel is a little way out of town but it runs its own Shuttle bus for 2 euros per journey right to the edge of the Grand Canal. The service takes you in and collects you at useful times of the day otherwise it is an easy 10 minute walk to get the regular bus service. Our room (105) was elegantly furnished, comfortable and warm. Optional breakfast, albeit in a dark coolish cellar, was nevertheless fine at a mere 5 euros. A hotel run by a family who will do their best for you including reliably transferring you to and from the airport - what more could you ask for an affordable price.
UR87502048	After looking at the glamerous website we had high expectations for this hotel and awaited our stay there with much anticipation. When we finally arrived (the hotel is miles out of Venice) naturally after a long day travelling we were hungry, however we were told by the hotel manager that the restaurant was closed and wouldn't be open until the 15th of December! After deciding that 3 weeks was a little too long to wait for dinner we were handed a take out pizza menu as compensation. The hotel manager told us we could order whatever we wanted in terms of food but handing us a pizza menu did rather limit our choice to just pizza or going hungry. The bedroooms were nice and cosy and also clean. The transport system around the hotel isn't great it involves catching two buses and the hotel is at the end of the bus route. Sometimes it is just worth spending a little extra money.
UR75276832	The hotel has a problem with mold. In our room was so bad air and a strong mildew odor that I could not sleep all night. Even the air conditioning did not help. In the bathroom the edges of the bath were completely black from mold. Really disgusting! We wanted to change the room, but the receptionist said, they are fully booked.
UR70899686	This villa was excellent, the rooms were very nicely done up. The person at the reception (forgot his name) was good at giving directions, etc n how to get to venice. There is a shuttle from the villa at a cheap cost but only at fixed hours in the morning, otherwise its expensive. Using public transport to get to Venice from here may take 45 mins from here. Suggest take ur car and park in the cheaper park places outside venice and then take a local bus from there. The downside to this place was finding it. The GPS went crazy trying to find this place as there was some construction in the area and some roads were closed. If u do decide to stay here, then call the hotel and ask them to give u directions before u start ur journey. They gave me another street address which helped me eventually find the place. The village where the villa is located has nothing to offer but the rooms were great. From the price this place was excellent.
UR68338585	This hotel is really lovely and the staff could not be more helpful. It is a little further from town than one might like, but it is very quiet and relaxing. We were there at the end of May, and the weather was getting hot. However, the hotel owner would not turn the air-conditioning on, so we did not sleep well. We could not have the windows open as there were lots of mosquitos. I think that considering that we chose and paid for a hotel with air-conditioning, this was unacceptable. If you like the sound and look of this hotel, then I would confirm with them, that you will get air conditioning before you finalise your booking.
UR63964325	If you want to see Venice but donâ€™t want to pay island prices this is for you. A really pretty venician hotel with a man called Nenad on the desk, what he does not know about the area and the cheapest way to get around is not possible. Great chap and can speak most languages. Situated in a pretty village with an excellent and cheap restaurant, 1 euro will give you 75 mins on the bus. 15 mins to Venice etc and 2.5 euro to marco polo which includes baggage, what a great and cheap way of getting around. Donâ€™t stay in Venice and pay their prices!!!
UR60807642	Finding Hotel Villa Dori may be difficult if you are not familiar with the bus system in regions outside of Venice (as most tourist maps do not cover Maestro) however, if you follow the instructions on the website, while making sure to communicate with the busdriver your desired destination you should be golden. There are not only several bus lines that take you to and from the train station and the heart of Venice, but the hotel provides a shuttle service (which is provided to you after checking in of course), and from any bus-stop, walking time does not exceed 10mins. Haid this, if you have more than one or two days in Venice, staying in Hotel Villa Dori is a great deal: The one and ONLY disadvantage is lost time due to bus-travel and limited shuttle operating-hours (note here that the ride is roughly 30mins, including the walk, but not necessarily including the wait) which is only combersome if you are pressed for time. The service is exceptional, especially the generous and knowledgable (as well as multilingual) front-desk receptionist named Nenad, who was exceedingly helpful in suggesting travel routes, hot spots and things to avoid in Venice and the surrounding islands. The hotel itself has charm and though I personally can sleep comfortably anywhere, I was delighted and SURPISED to have found such a clean and inexpensive hotel, with all of the amenities of a Marriot, just outside of Venice.
UR56177914	A nice hotel with helpful staff. They gave good advice on places to go - sites, food, tours etc. and arranged regular shuttles in the morning and evening for those that didn't want to labour with the regular bus. Rooms are maybe not as good as expected but pretty enough anyway. Hotel is about 15 minutes by shuttle (or 30 mins by regular bus) outside of Venice itself.
UR47365217	awesome rooms and nice staff, a bit out the way but a taxi provided
UR32098599	if you have a car, donÂ´t think twice: stay in this hotel. itÂ´s cute, very clean, with everything you must need and cheap! If you DONÂ´T have a car, donÂ´t go to this hotel. It has only one bus line to get there, that takes so long to take. you have to take 2 buses to arrive. and besides itÂ´s not even on the city of Mestre, but in the country side! If you donÂ´t care about getting lost in the middle of rural camp sites... so go there! it will be at least a little bit funny! the staff is very good. but well, if you are going to venice, go there and stay there. if you donÂ´t want to spend money, stay near the FS MESTRE, but NEAR, like, crossing the street. At least youÂ´ll have more transportation options in buses.
UR28433205	It was a little effort to reach there but we loved the place once we got there. Excellent value for money. I absolutely recommend it. The rooms were big with very good and big beds. Excellent showers and bathrooms. Its in a very quite and nice locality. Much better than the main Venice if you want to save some bucks. The staff was friendly and helpful. Sadly they don't serve food but there are a couple o places nearby.
UR27250858	Location - Hotel is a good 30 minutes away from the Venice boat terminal. Has ample car parking if you have a car. Hotel staff recommended we drive to a carpark which costs 5 euros a day near the terminal and then catch a bus in. Worked out ok, but was a bit of hassle. This hotel is not near anything, so if you don't have a car, you'll have to depend on the somewhat irregular shuttle service. Room - The room was dimly lit, so really hard to see anything. Had a strange odour, probably from mildew in the bathroom. Bathroom was a major problem, as another person on tripadvisor has warned, the showerhead is placed in a position which can cause the whole bathroom room to flood and there is no drainage so you get to enjoy a small swimming pool. Wireless internet is pretty expensive - 15 euros for 24 hours. Paid for it but didn't get any reception in my room so had to use it in the lobby. Stopped working after a few hours, they couldn't fix the problem so noone had internet for one day. On the plus side, the guy at hotel reception was really helpful. Gave us heaps of tips on what to see. He'll show you all the good sights on map (which he'll charge you 2 euro for), but well worth it. Unfortunately, during the evenings, they have an older woman at reception who speaks no english, so don't expect any help from reception when she is on.
UR23773387	I had read the reviews on the site i was a little hesitant. i thought we were going to end up no where near venice. However, i was plesently surprised. We did arrive on a sunday and were only able to get a bus to the local train station from there the buses only run hourly and a free pick up is not an option it must be pre booked and paid for. Once at the hotel the receptionist was friendly helpful and spoke very good english for an extra ten euros you can have a buffet breakfast (which is the only option without a car) there is nothing else in the area so make sure you are stocked up before you get there. Also the resturant is not open on Monday nights we were unaware and were lucky enough that we met a lovely kiwi family that picked up a pizza for us. The rooms were clean, tidy and very comfortable. Considering i could have stayed in a hostel in venice for the same price i was very impressed. It is a little to far out however, they are willing to drop you whereever and whenever you need to go (for a fee of course) all in all it was quite enjoyable and would reccomend to anyone wanting cheap accomodation.
UR18116824	I recently stayed at hotel Villa Dori and wanted to write and tell what I thought about my stay. The room was very nice and very clean. The breakfast was very good. The cost was very reasonable. The best part of the stay was the hotel staff, Jessica in particular was very pleasant and helpful, which is great when it's your first trip abroad and you don't speak the langauge. Hotel Villa Dori was great.
UR18072409	It looked good, sounded good and the price was right according to their website. The hotel is miles from anywhere about 1 to 2 hours from Old Venice by bus and 35 mins by hotel shuttle VW 8 seater. There is no lounge, no restaurant, no bar. There is a vending machine with soft drinks and the cheapest beer in small cans for 2 euro. The can of beer plonks down the machine then if you open it beer squirts allover the place. No breakfast in bed service. Breakfast 8 to 10 am. Be there before 9am or everything is gone. It last saw a coat of paint about 8 years ago. Bed was clean and linn chganged every day. But, Jesus, what a nightmare of a place. It's reall like a hostel where you just sleep. The shuttle dropped us at a restaurant5 about 2 km. from the place and we rang at 9.30 p.m. to be collected. He arrived 2 hours later. I am in my 60s and have arthritis in my hip and walk with the aid of a stick. This place is a con job and should really be closed down. Thankfully it is not expensive for the bed. You pay for the shuttle everywhere. It costs 15 euro to go to the bus pick up for the airport which is shared by whoever uses it. But if you are alone it's still 15euro. I can't say how bad it is. Weeds everywhere Yuk.
UR17822297	Hotel was not bad. We had a room on graund floor , which is basicly a cellar. Rooms are not to big, on walls are drapery so it takes smells. Staff was ok, we where lucky to meet a recepcionist from our country so we had all the hellp we could get. They have a shuttle service for a price of 20 Euro, per ride to a Venice. Location of the hotel is bad, it is very isolatet, and not wery well conected with buses. There is no restourante or super market anywhere neer.
UR17345217	Unfortunately, the Villa Dori is not a good example of Venetian hospitality. Apart from being in the middle of nowhere - ok they are trying with that, they do provide a shuttle bus 2.50 euros per person, each way - booked in advance to and from Venice as long as you can get on it, and the times are suitable to you, latest pick up in Venice is 10.30 pm! (or else it's a 30 euro taxi ride) The rooms are very small, the television's don't work, there are no tea/coffee/anything facililties in the rooms, (or anywhere else - oh sorry, tell a lie - 1 broken vending machine in the foyer) 1 very thin pillow each - no spares, very little storage for clothes. This can all be lived with but neither the bar nor the restaurant were open at all, so nothing to drink or eat - there are no cafe's in the area at all. Breakfast was not included in the price -7 euros and it was disgusting. The staff (all but one very pleasant young lady) were very close to rude, not helpful in the slightest. It was such a disappointment - I would not recommend the Villa Dori to anybody.
UR14989003	Very strange place to stay. It is as if they are all playing 'hotels'. Staff give confusing information about transport etc. We had to wait an hour on arrival at airport, not a good start. When you book shuttle you pay, receptionist gets tickets out of a locked box then you give them to driver who gives them back to her to lock in box again. WHY? Also if driver was ready and all passengers were ready still couldn't leave till precise time booked.WHY? Our shower flooded bathroom floor when used and towels are like tea towels. Ate one night in restaurant food good but wine appalling. My advice stay in Venice itself. It may be more moneybut you will save money on travelling in and out and not have to go through ticket fiasco every day'.
UR14935702	This hotel is good value for the price, however it is a long ride from Venice....NOT 10 minutes by any means. Journey time was approx 20mins by hotel minibus and longer by public transport, plus the walk to the bus stops - this made it a very long day to stay in Venice without any possibility of return to rest/change. The restaurant needs an X rating for some of the painted designs on some of the tables, not something I enjoyed eating my breakfast from! The restaurant name Tantra should be made clear...not in good taste. The young man on reception was particularly helpful and spoke really good English. We had a good break but would definitely book in Venice itself if I were to go again.
UR10980974	If you are travelling by car and will be stopping in Venice for a couple of days, this hotel is a good choice. No problems with parking at the hotel and from there you can take the shuttle to Venice. The ride takes about 20-25 minutes, depending on traffic. not the "10 minutes" as advertised on their website. Our room was big for european standards, with very standard amenities. For the price it was good value. The restaurant was being remodelled, so I cannot comment on the quality, and we didn't have the problem other reviewers had with the noise every night.
UR8280078	I booked via internet and stayed in an appartement of this hotel which in the first place was not told that was separated from the main hotel building and is located in a separate land behind the main building. No picture of the appartement was not on the internet. Arrving there with six persons I had no time to argue about this and simply accepted the fact. Then found out that there was no hot water. After complaining the receptionists lied to me that it will be repaired while we were gone but later I came to know via their discussions among them that they were not able to get the engineer on a week end. So I had NO hot water for three whole days, the whole length of time I stayed. The temperature out side was 23 degrees and you can imagine how we felt taking cold showers morning and nights after walking so much in Venice. Never again will I book this hotel and will not recommend to any other either.
UR8068545	Villa Dori was a really nice hotel, a surprise for the price. But then you consider it's location, and things start to come together. The hotel is wonderful, staff was nice, there was internet in the lobby free to be used. The rooms were elegantly decorated (we were in the Oriental-style rooms). There were 3 per room... there was a Queen sized bed, and a twin. The room was kind of cramped though. There was also a television, though we were confused as to how to turn channels, or was it how to turn it on? The bathroom was pretty big. There was a shower, no tub... but that didn't bother us. The utilities seemed new and clean. The problem was it's location. The directions from the general bus station in town was confusing. We flew into Venice Treviso (through RyanAir). We had to take a coach bus to this town that begins with an "M." Then we had to take local transportation to the hotel. Except, we only speak English, couldn't read road signs and bus stops weren't really marked on the streets. You're on this bus for awhile, and you're kind of driving through boondocks/manufacturing-looking areas. So we hopped off when we saw the street, but it was premature. We had to walk some to finally get to the hotel. And then, to go to Venice, we had to walk back that same distance to catch this other public bus. That bus took about 25minutes to get into Venice. And we were only in Venice for 1 day, so we booked the hotel transfer service to pick us up from Venice that evening. We went back to Venice the next morning using that same public bus. Once you know what to do, it's not that much of a pain. So other than that confusing bout, Villa Dori was a good stay. Nothing really around the hotel that I could see. If you're looking to stay IN VENICE, this isn't the place for you! But if you're willing to walk a bit for a nice, comfy, budget stay... this is a great option!
UR7957629	this little hotel is a great deal, for the price of a sketchy, dirty, tiny room in florence you get a pretty stylish, comfy mid-sized room that's clean and quiet (during the week, at least, i don't know about the weekend). they offer a shuttle into the city, or you can easily catch a bus a block away that takes you to the train station, and from there it's just a cheap and short ride into venice. the staff is helpful and english speaking, and the internet if free, though there's often a little wait for it. i was sharing a room with one other person, but there seemed to be a fair number of larger groups of backpackers sharing rooms, too, who they seemed pretty accomodating of. i would definitely stay here again.
UR6635518	I couldn't believe my eyes when we opened the door of our room. I loved the decor and the four poster bed and felt like a princess. The hotel is in a quiet area and only 10 minutes drive from Venice by the shuttle bus leaving the hotel every morning and collecting you from Venice every evening.( you will have to book it at the reception for each day at â‚¬ 2.50 each way) We were agreeably surprised by the welcome too as everything was explained to us on arrival and our trip was made very easy by it. The breakfast was a bit more expensive than expected (â‚¬ 7/person) but well worth it with a big variety of food from pastry to cheese. I also loved the decor of the restaurant next to the hotel but we only tried cocktails (the cocktail menu was very impressive). I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We will certainly go back there. Greg and Veronique Room 128 15 to 19th January 2007
UR5776628	We found this hotel in the web. But did not reserved rooms before arriving, since did not know the exact time schedule of our trip to Venice. When we arrived, it was a peak season (end of August), since the film festival and the Regatta started that week as well. But we found free rooms at a very reasonable price (60 EUR/night, the breakfast was an additional 10 EUR/2 pers.). The room had too much baroq decoration to our taste, but were very nicely decorated, extremely clean and spacious (though it was a triple room for two of us). The bathroom was also very big and clean with a good size window as well. We had a chance to have a look to other double rooms as well, but these were very narrow and dark rooms, so we decided to have the 3 bedded room (the nightly price was the same). The location was great: it was in a few minutes walking distance from the bus stop to Venice. And the "Venice" bus takes you to the city centre (Piazzale Roma) within 20 minutes). The staff was very welcoming, nice and helpful. We had a very quiet night sleep in this hotel after an other noisy hotel in Mestre, where we spent 3 noisy and tirying nights with disturbin drunken Australian tourist groups. After that Villa Dori was a silent oasis. But we know: it was a uniq period of the year when the cafÃ© (it is really a night club) is closed for a month, that's why the place was extremely silent and quiet. It could be very noisy at night when the night club is in operation! All in all our stay was very good.
UR5046151	If you are thinking of staying at this hotel, I would reconsider. The internet website we booked through had incorrect information provided from the hotel. We NEED internet connection while travelling and book hotels who can provide this. The website stated they did. Well after getting completely lost over and over again, as this hotel is pretty much in the sticks, we settled in our room and then realised their mistake. We decided to speak to the hotel keeper about the issue, she could not speak english, so we translated our problem to Italian. She just walked out and slammed the door. This happened a few times, ignored, walked out on, just completley rude. Fortunatly the gentleman behind the front desk in the morning was able to cancel the rest of the book as he completely understood. Well the rooms are very small, nicely decorated, but completely ruined with huge signs in english stating "DO NOT PUT ANYTHING IN THE TOILET.... CHECKOUT IS 10am IF YOU ARE LATE AT ALL YOU WILL BE CHARGED ANOTHER NIGHT".... These signs were hard to ignore and obstructed against the decore... and well just seemed a little rude... Find something in Vencie or if you have a car like us find something in Mestre... easier to get the public transport buses to venice. and hopefully not as rude either.
UR5030041	This was our first visit to Venice and we were so much looking forward to it. The hotel is very pleasant in appearance, the rooms are small but perfectly adequate. The decor is very expensive with fabric lined walls, Murano Glass chandeliers and antique furniture. Beds are a little soft, but we were overall very happy. decent price too. The hotel is a little way out of Venice, but they are very helpful in running a shuttle bus into the centre of Venice, (few hotels do), which can be booked for times convenient to you at a resonable cost. They also offer airport transfers, very handy, at 20 Euros. Continental breakfast is available in the adjoining restaurant between 8 and 10am for 5 Euros per person, but get there early as they run out of food and do not replenish. The big disappointment for us was the restaurant / night club. We dined there on the first night and it was very average. Seafood only, but they also serve pizza. At 10pm this restaurant turns into the noisiest night club in the world and unfortunately our room was directly above it. We complained several times at the reception, but found the staff very un helpful. Their answer was 'what do you expect us to do about it', and 'you are the only ones who are complaining'! It felt as though the whole room was shaking, we finally got to sleep at 3am, not happy teddy bears. The next day we complained again, were moved to a quieter room, and again told that we were the only ones who complained. We later met 3 other couples who had also complained and received similar service. This is clearly a regular problem for them, but that does not excuse their unhelpful and dishonest attitude. In my opinion they should not use these rooms at all since you are guaranteed no sleep until the night club closes at 3am. In summary, Venice Hotel Villa Dori has many things to recommend it and I would use the hotel again, but ONLY if I was guaranteed not to get a room above the restaurant / night club.
UR4695010	First off, the location! Since I had rented a car and was travelling throughout Italy, I liked that the hotel was located in a quiet residential neighborhood with plenty of FREE parking. The staff is super friendly and super informative. When we arrived to check-in, the gentleman at the front desk explained all the different options of how to get to venice be it the bus, the hotel shuttle, or by car. We had a car so the trip from the hotel to Venice, went like this. We drove about 10 minutes from the hotel to just before the bridge that takes you to Venice. Before the bridge, there's guarded secure parking lots that run 24 hours a day and charge only 4 Euros per day to park there. Unbelievably good deal since the parking garages on Venice Island were around 20 Euros a day. There's a bus stop in front of the parking lot and you can take any bus into Venice which is about a 5 to 10 minute ride. Get a 24 hour bus and boat pass which you can buy at the hotel for the same price you'd pay in Venice. It provides unlimited travel on buses and boats for 24 hours when you first get your ticket stamped which is either on your first ride on the bus or boat. Great deal and saves you a ton of money if you plan to use the boat to get around in Venice more than a couple of times. Breakfast could be had at a restaurant next door to the hotel for 5 Euros but after taking a peak at what was offered, I opted to wait and eat in Venice on the island. The hotel rooms were amazing! They were beautifully decorated, very spacious, and very comfortable. The hotel had a free internet computer located at the front desk which was great to check-email and communicate with family and friends. Hotel was a great deal, and again the room was spectacular. My only complaint is that the hotel walls are pretty thin meaning you should request a room away from the club/restaurant. One of the nights we were there it was closed and everything was quiet. The other night we were there you could hear the music through the walls until about 2am when it closed and then was quiet again. For the price and the size and quality of the room you can't beat this place!!!
UR4473614	Yes, the rooms are very nice for the price, BUT they lost our booking and made us stay at a small, cold B and B in the middle of nowhere on our first night which was nothing like the room we had booked at the hotel. Also, I found the staff were very entrepreneurial at every corner (shuttle bus to venice, but it costs 2.50 each way) and they also lied to us and told us we had to pay our 10 per cent deposit twice (we had booked on an internet site months before). So, once you can find it, the place is nice, but the staff seemed more interested in making money than you having a nice time, and the location isnt at all convenient.
UR139439979	A full motel could bring problems and it did the first night. Too much noise by other guests pass midnight. The next three days were a perfect experience. Our family had a perfect vacation. The room, the RATE, the deck, the pool, is a great pick for a family. YOU cannot go wrong booking here.
UR138726315	My husband and I stayed here in a "City View" two queen suite for one night after a day of jet skiing. The front desk staff was friendly and overall we had an enjoyable stay. Our only complaint was the worn looking, thin bath towels.
UR138357185	My family and I were looking forward to a great vacation this summer and we looked at visitng one of our relatives in florida. we did not want to burden them with hospitality, so we decided to stay by one of the closest hotels by daytona beach. our experience here was wonderful! the place was very clean, the staff was friendly, and most of all, the location was perfect. we will be visitng or relatives here again at daytona beach soon in the future, so we definitely look forward to revisitng this place again!
UR136182140	We stayed at this property once previously. We always stop in Daytona Beach on our way to visit family in Ft. Lauderdale, and some of the places we have stayed at have been not as nice as La Quinta. For the price we paid and for what we got, it was a good value. I liked the room. It was a good sized room, and it was clean. In the humid climate, it is a plus that they have tiled flooring instead of carpeting in the area where you walk with dirty, sandy feet. The shower and toilet are separate from the sink, which I always consider to be a plus when you are sharing a room with another person. The TV was old school, but it was large enough and had good reception. The bedspreads were clean and in good condition. I was very happy with the cotton blanket! Yes, it seemed to be freshly laundered, not some ratty blanket that has not seen a washing in some unknown period of time. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was standard chain motel food: waffles, coffee, yogurt, etc. A couple of things I did not like about the room: One was the noisy air-conditioner. I turned it off at one point because of the noisy sound coming from it. The other thing that bothered me a great deal was the harsh-white fluorescent lighting in the room. How can you relax in your room when the lighting resembles that of an office building? Perhaps some soft-white CFL's can be added to make the room cozier. The outside area was clean and nice. The pool was clean, as was the hot tub. There was a large deck area with umbrellas both beside the pool and outside of the pool area. Dogs are not allowed in that area, so if you bring a dog, plan to walk him somewhere else. There is easy beach access, with a shower and faucet for clean-up when you are finished with the beach. We would stay at this property again, since we believe it is one of the better Daytona Beach properties and we like to get points for our stay.
UR136124122	No real complaints, but maybe because it was my first experience taking my puppy on a trip, the term "pet friendly" is a bit of a stretch. First of all, the pets are confined to your room, the parking lot, and a little 10x15 fenced in patch for doing their business. I had sign a waiver that if my dog made too much noise, and the neighbors complained that I was responsible to pay for their room. Also we could not leave our puppy in the room alone at any time, nor was she allowed to be on any of the furniture. Not that I would invite her to jump on the sofa, but I was worried she may decide to pop up on it and I would be charged a $ 100 extra for cleaning. The hotel itself is nice, a bit tired, but great views and pool area. The beds are comfortable, and the free wi-fi made it nice since I was on puppy duty the entire stay. The bathroom was small, but adequate, and the room came with a microwave, and small fridge. Breakfast was nothing to dream about, the breakfast room is not nearly large enough to handle the morning rush, but food was well stocked, and kept clean. The best item they had was the waffles, and the coffee was good too. All in all, I would go back, but leave my pooch at home or look for a resort that had more space for my four legged friend.
UR135719506	We stayed here just for one night while passing through Daytona. Used to live in area and was happy to see the remodeled hotel, it was tastefully remodeled throughout and staff was more than helpful. We did have a few problems with our room, but the manager compensated us for the issues we had. Would stay here again, but next time would wnt to change our room so we don't have to be inconvenienced by maintenance being done while we were there.
UR135017620	OMG cnt believe it, wat kind of service n rate I got, I knw one thing they get my bussines, I told them n I knw that, when ever I go dayton beach, im going to stay in same hotel, wat u need n wat u looking for on vacation, all in one place , jt like one stop n thats it,jt think why I said extra excellent, when u drive 9 hours n its nite n u walk to the counter n that person give u nice smile n nice talk n give u greatest prices in town, n u knw u cnt find no where in town n its be ocean front, on that time u remember only 3 words yes txs n sold it, next thing u knw u be in yr cold room rit front of big t.v on big bed n rit front of beach looking rit on it n enjoying pool view, u guys need to stay thir,
UR134768870	Clean room that welcomed our pet. The Inn is right there on the ocean strip. Pool was lovely. Staff was accommodating. Only real complaint was the lack of space for dog "walking."
UR134533498	We stayed for one night in late May 2012. The hotel was clean looking on the outside and the lobby was nicely decorated, so I thought I had made a good decision. Parking lot is very small and hard to get in and out of. Got to our room on the 2nd floor, first thing we notice was a spider web in corner full of small bugs, cleaned that up. Floor was clean looking, but once you walked across a few times, your socks were flithy. There was a repaired hole in the bathroom door, never painted back to match door, tub constantly dripped. Bed was comfortable, but comforter was not clean, sliding door was very hard to open. Made the mistake of ordering from one of those pizza places they slide the menu under the door, worse thing we could have done! Don't ever order from Sicilly's pizza, throw their menu in the garbage. Took almost 1.5 hours to get to our room, it was tough and not really hot. The delivery driver lied about why it took so long (we had been calling the manager of the pizza place constantly, so we knew what was up). Food made us ill the next morning. Found out when we left hotel, the place we ordered from was only 2 blocks away! NEVER again...... There are many mid level hotels in DB. Do your research and spend wisely, you can get better quality for your bucks somewhere else. Only good highlight was the free breakfast was pretty good variety. Make your own waffles, yogurt, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, juices etc. Not all pre package like other places.
UR134385647	bad smell in the room and bathroom clean,friendly dog,close to beach.
UR134378152	location is perfect. Rooms are nice, I like most of the floor is tile. Beautiful view. The pool is nice. Only downside is small parking but not a big deal. The air conditioner was slightly loud but again not big deal. Location is far enough from the pier but close enough too.
UR133864306	we have stayed twice and enjoyed the visit both times , hotel and the location are just right and could'nt be better...
UR133737846	i was very happy with the stay. Room was very clean and very nice set up. I used to be a housekeeping manager for another group and look at stuff like that all the time. The room was spotless! Thank you Katy for the great help during brealfast and check out. This was my second stay and I will be going again for sure
UR133720904	After I had booked my stay, I had read some bad reviews and was a little nervous but we had no complaints. Staff was accommodating. The room was clean and smelled fresh. The pull out couch had a very thin mattress but that is to be expected. Did smell urine, assume pet urine, in one of stairwells and near balcony. Breakfast had just a few offerings but it was OK. Location is good, short walk to boardwalk. Would consider staying here again.
UR132817513	Our room was ready when we arrived. It was clean and twice as large as the last hotel I'd stayed in. This location was pet friendly but you need to register your pet when you first check in though. The hotel has an overflow lot for when the on-site parking lot is full. There is actually a very small fenced dog area that I found; but, it looked as if it was being redone as there was a freshly dug hole in it. Wireless internet was available, but my connection in the room was weak and prone to drops.
UR132479858	We checked in around 8pm all aound the proprty was young people with beers in their hands swaring being very loud. I have a 9 yrs old son and did not like the surroundings for him. If that wasnt enuff we went into our room where we found some other surprises the pull out couch had not been changed and had urine spots on the sheets and mattres. I went to the office to let them know and the only thing i got was a promise to move in the morning and some sheets to change the couch. We put down trash bags in the mattress and i changed the sheets. All of this for just 212.00 dollars . While in the lobby waiting on sheets two others were complaing one about the pullout couch and the other about the pepole out side. The only thing i nreceived was a stanard email hoping we would stay with them again. No body in their right mind would stay again after what we found.
UR132449361	This is a very nice pet friendly hotel. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The balcony with an ocean view were a great way to start the day. The staff could not have been better. Parking is very limited and the pet area is small.
UR132444960	Great place! View of the ocean from the balcony was worth the extra cost. Easy access from the hotel to the beach. The pool area is great for cooling off and relaxing away from the salt water for a while. The staff at this hotel repeatedly went above and beyond for us and were genuinely friendly. If we're ever back in Daytona Beach, we'll definitely stay here again.
UR132404248	We stayed 5 nights. Thought it was a good deal with a government employee discount. Lobby smells of mold/mildew. Desk employees were very nice, but didn't do much about complaints. Main concern was the old, horrible, broken fold out couch, which my daughter was to sleep on. We pulled out the couch and there were all sorts of dirty, crumbs and filth on the floor underneath it. Then, 4 springs fell out of the bottom of it, where her feet would lay, and there was a huge dip in it. Squeaked horribly with the smallest movement. Told man at front desk and he just said "sorry." Not the cleanest room, but ok. Sheets stained and had to get bedding for the fold out couch. Sink clogged. another lady was complaining to front desk that her pull out couch was dirty, smelled of urine, and asked for a refund and was checking out. I don't know what happened there. Parking is a nightmare! Not enough stalls and if you're lucky to get one, they are so narrowly spaced apart, you can't back out! All those trucks and you can't even move! Double beds in our "family" suite? It's one large room, with a half divider, only 2 chairs. No workout room, as advertised. You enter your room from the outside, like an old fashioned motel. Loud and noisy people stay here. Forget about getting any breakfast! Poorly stocked. The overworked desk person has to answer phones, check in customers and stock the breakfast! I'd say they are in need of more staff! Glad to have that discount, because spending $180 a night for this "family suite" would have been a waste of money! Will not stay here again.
UR132063710	i have to admit when i first checked in i was a bit skeptical because this hotel was priced a little higher than some of the others in the immediate area but after a few nights here i realized it was well worth it. For starters you wont find transient type guests at this hotel the way you often do at many other mid range priced Daytona properties. All of the guests are travelers on vacation, and its a very family friendly atmosphere. The rooms are recently renovated, very comfortable beds, and easily the best pillows ive ever slept on in a hotel. The AC is cold, and rooms are equipped with microwave, and decent size fridge, coffee maker, and hair dryer. The tv gets 73 channels plus HBO, and the walls are very thick so you will not hear any noise from the rooms on either side of you. Beyond the rooms, a breezeway with tropical music playing leads to the pool area, which is both is clean and inviting, Also the pool has a very unique mushroom shaped fountain where you can douse yourself with flowing cold water on a hot florida day. If the pool isnt your thing, the hotel is right on the beach and you can walk from your room to the ocean in literally 3 minutes. The location in daytona is also excellent, less than a mile from the Ocean walk shoppes restaurants, and boardwalk amusement activities, and only a quarter mile from the clubs ,bars and other nightlife on Seabreeze Blvd. The staff is friendly welcoming and accomodating, especially front desk clerk Daniel, and the 2 managers karli and Tony. There lobby is also very attractive, and offers free coffee 24-7, a business center with a computer, and printer, available 24-7, and a free daily continental breakfast with everything from donuts, english muffins, danish's , and even waffles, as well as juice and coffee. Overall if youre looking for a mid-range priced hotel right on the beach in daytona, youll be hard pressed to find one better than the La Quinta inn & suites - D
UR131783122	Stayed in this hotel two days, big rooms, clean and right by the beach, love it. Will stay there again.
UR131702970	World Class Customer Service is a title they deserve. Ist trip ever to Daytona Beach traveling w/our cat. Manager Karly met and exceeded our expections with her friendly overview of the area, recommendations of sights and kindness personalty. We upgraded to a oceanview suite on the second day and enjoyed the overwhelming beauty of the ocean. Plan to make this a regular.
UR131514588	Great stay, very satisfied with the room I had, overlooking the ocean. Great airconditioner, clean, and a good breakfast.
UR131373773	I was checking in the hotel and a lady was moping the floor with fabuloso, the manager just put out one of those automatic air fresher, and the front desk clerk had a can of air freshner in her hand. All of this was happening at the same time and NO, I didn't get the hint. We check in our room, which had a strange smell. We opened the door to let fresh air in and two dogs came inside the room. We went to the front desk to get another room. The second room was even worst. I just could not stay there. The smell was so awful!!
UR131287524	Now this is a real antique. No doubt the worst of the LQ chain. Place should have been torn down years ago. Nothing whatever to recommend it except it is right on the beach. You want a beach front room but they are outrageously over priced. Not a good deal on points either. I wiped out 2 months worth of points on a 2 day stay AND paid $50 for a 2nd floor walkup with no window. If you remember Daytona in the 60s, it hasn't changed one whit except the boardwalk is now concrete and tile and the pier is reopening with a Joes Crab Shack in June. Big Wyndham is new too. Otherwise....the same. A time capsule that this LQ fits right into.
UR131203184	The room was clean and well stocked and despite the fact that several families with kids and pets were staying there you did not hear them thru the walls. We had a king suite with an ocean view on the second floor May 31st thru June 3rd. The bed was comfortable and as far as smells were concerned there were the usual smells that come with staying in a motel oceanside. The only offensive noises were a group of partygoers in the courtyard outside our room, we shut our sliding glass door fixing that problem. We would definetly stay again in the future.
UR130895949	Had a great time here other than a drowning outside the hotel. BIG bugs outside and one lazy outside worker hiding talking on his cell. Fairly clean well kept hotel for the budget minded. Lots of loud noises in the nite. Free Wi-Fi my butt. Wi-Fi is time limited with password. 2 to 5 minutes at best before you have to reenter password & user. Very, very annoying. Will lock u out of yor banking if ur not careful. May look for another place to try our in 2 Wks..
UR129378242	My wife, two kids and myself stayed one night, April 28th at this hotel. We went to bed late, and the kids feel asleep right away. We didn't get in bed until it was too late. The mattress smelled like cat pee, but too late in the evening to complain. The hotel was booked and nowhere to move too, even if we could. When we were checking out I noticed they were swapping out mattress in other rooms for new one, so I suspect they knew of this problem, yet let us and others still stay without warning. I'm fine with pet friendly hotel (we have a dog, but left him home), but the hotel should make sure the rooms are clean, fresh and sanitary. When i told the desk clerk in the morning he seem somewhat apologetic yet, he really didn't care. This review is for the 816 North Atlantic, Daytona Beach location. We have stayed at many La Quinta's in the past, but don't recommend this one. Awful experience. I filed a complaint with La Quinta and they mentioned they would forwarded it to the management, but we have yet to hear back. Word to the wise, ask to see and SMELL the room before checking in, unless you like sleeping in cat pee.
UR128559523	This was my first visit to this hotel although I visit Daytona many times a year for business. I was very comfortable and the ocean view room was simply outstanding. I have stayed at much pricier places but this Hotel was well worth the money. The staff was very nice and my visit was very nice. I will be back
UR128121283	EVERYTHING about my nearly month stay at the La Quinta in Daytona Beach was absolutely Top Notch ! Every employee was very accomidating anytime i had a question or needed anything. EVERYONE that works there has a very pleasant manner. The rooms themselves are clean & provide spacious comfort as well as even having some rooms that have seperate bedrooms within them. It's pet Friendly , which is extremely rare to find , especially if You have larger breed dogs. I was very pleased with my stay there & when I return I will look forward to staying there again.
UR127988179	I usually get a very good rate when I stay here...not the case this time but I needed the beach access since we were going surfing and I needed easy access to store our boards. So for the price I could have stayed at a better hotel but probably would not have ease of surfboard storage. I have been staying at this hotel since last year for my business trips and it always has been a good hotel but I did notice on this trip that the bed covers had holes on them, some of the sheets had stains(did not tell wife or she would freak), towels were very worn and had some stains. If they would just update the sheets and stuff it would get a 5 star rating.
UR127794336	We choose this hotel because we wanted an Ocean Front room and wanted to take our Dog, We got the Family Suite and couldnt be more satisfied. There seemed to be a good number of people with dogs at this hotel. The Pool Area etc is off limits for dogs but that is understandable. There is a Small Dog business area Complete with a Poop Baggie Dispenser. I found that there are many "empty" lots in close proximity the Hotel where my dog liked to visit. The Staff was great. Many of times we would be at the front desk getting extra towels/Blankets/Pillows etc with no hesitation from the Staff. The rooms were cleaned daily. We just told them when we would be leaving with the dog, and poof when we returned the room would be cleaned. The Owner seemed very nice and cared about the Customers stay. The first night we felt that the AC was not working properly. About 11pm we called the front desk and told them. Within 5 minutes, the owner was there to inspect. He determined it needed a new unit, and the next morning a new AC as installed. He did help us on the rate that nigth as well. Parking was a bit of a Challenge if arriving late a night, However they did have an overflow Lot across the street which was not a big deal at all to use, as well as ALL NIGHT security in the Lot. Overall a great Hotel for the money.
UR127158467	I took my kids, and one of their friends to Daytona Beach for Spring Break. I don't understand any of the complaints I have seen on here!! I think some people expect $500 rooms for $139!! To start, we were early, but were greeted kindly, and advised we could go ahead and check in at 1:45pm. We were just in from a very long drive, and there were cookies at the desk for guests.......the kids were thrilled!! Our room was oceanfront, and poolside. We couldn't have asked for better!! We opened the curtains, and it was breathtaking!! The pool area and garden/fountain area were very clean and pretty. The hot tub was also nice, and very relaxing! It was a 30 second walk to the ocean!! We found the room to be clean, comfortable, and quite lovely. We had a new HD tv, and we used the internet daily without problems. The housekeeping service was awesome, and we were met with smiles and speedy service when needing more supplies. We were able to walk to the pier, and many shops and restaurants. It is within very short driving distance of Publix, a dollar store, and several other standard shops. We couldn't recommend it more....we WILL return!!
UR127152644	We chose this hotel for a last minute one night trip to Daytona Beach. It has a great location - right on the beach and centrally located on the strip. It was moderately priced. We had what they call a 2 bedroom. As you enter the room, the first area held a double bed. There was a TV and fridge with a (noisy) A/C unit. The 2nd 'bedroom' was just off of the first. The only (very small) bathroom was located in the 2nd bedroom so there wasn't much privacy but it was very quiet back in the 2nd bedroom. However, there were no windows in the back bedroom or bathroom, so it was a little claustrophobic. One concern is the parking. After waiting for a while for an empty parking spot, we met up with the nighttime security guard who found us a spot. We ended up having to park along the edge of the parking lot. Anyone with poor driving skills (or too much to drink) might have easily clipped our car. The breakfast is pretty decent, although the front desk clerk (only one on duty) had to run between the front desk and breakfast area to keep stocking it. All the staff we encountered were polite. Overall, a decent place for a reasonable amount of money.
UR126980421	LOVE this place. Beautiful view. Beautiful & comfortable rooms. Owner is a great guy & works with customers on any issue that may arise. Perfect family, group, or couple getaway. Only miss the double lounge chair that was there on my 1st stay. lol.
UR126796416	Location, Location, Location is the key at this hotel located right on the ocean. If you get ocean view you are steps away from it. The place is clean and comfortable for an average hotel and the price is right for location. Includes breakfast in the morning and cookies at night. They have a pool & hot tub in enclosed area for safety conscious parents. Free Wi-FI included in price which was nice.
UR125527761	The staff at the front desk when we came in were very nice. Our room was wonderful with a beautiful view of the ocean. The pool was nice and while we were out there the owner an manager came out an was checking on everyone to make sure everyone was happy with the hotel. Would stay there again!
UR125255643	This was my first visit to Daytona Beach so I wanted to stay at a place that was right on the beach, with a pool and close to shopping, the pier and restaurants. The hotel was definitely more of a 'motel' style. The room was spacious but after walking in, we immediately felt the humidity and moisture in the room. The tv was older but worked fine as well as the mini fridge and microwave. We weren't sure the sheets were changed every night even though we asked them to be. My sister spilled a bit of red wine on the sheets one night and the next day, though the beds were made, the stain from the spill was still there. I liked that there was a safe but it was old and kind of rusty. I would have preferred it have a key for me to hold on to instead of a digital one where I created a code. The hotel was literally on the beach and had private access which was nice. The pool was great and there were lots of lounge chairs for guests to use.
UR125133315	Stayed there on business 2/21 to 2/23. Old TV laying in middle of floor in bedroom upon check in. Was told it was be replaced--never was. I have to shove it to the corner. They rented the adjacent room to some very questionable hoods--who stood outside and smoked half the night. The seal around the front door was so poor you could pass a magazine through it. They placed a $200 hold on my credit card for "incidentals". Paid my room in full and there were ZERO incidental purchases to be made. When I questioned this at checkout--desk clerk couldn't explain it. Manager came our and was not helpful either. I travel frequently on business all over the U.S....will make sure this location is never selected again.
UR124272916	We had no reservation for this area and found this beachfront place very accomodating. It was in a great location nice and quiet, steps to the beach and the rooms were clean for us. For the price you can't beat this inn . We have stayed at other La Quintas in our travels and haven't been disappointed yet The only thing I would change is have a heated pool.
UR123379786	Very friendly and helpful hotel staff. Bathroom floors were not cleaned thoroughly (dirty in the corners and moldings) and are loud (fans) and dark (dark colored marble). Bathroom doors (interior) need to be scrubbed. The rest of the room was clean and well kept... but the veranda/balcony overlooking the beach and ocean had been used as a smoking parlor (we had a non-smoking room) and it wreaked of cigarettes so much so that when you opened the patio doors... the breeze made the room smell like an ashtray. Smell was a bit less on the 2nd day. The balcony overlooked the pool and came equipped with two chairs and a small table. Nice. There were also extra towels to be used if we went swimming. The executive desk was nice with extra plugs on the side but the OVERSIZED office chair was not on wheels and completely blocked the walk way to the balcony and was incredibly heavy and hard to move. The room was nicely appointed with a microwave and refrigerator. Laundry facilities on the first floor are OLD and rusty and the dryers didn't go long enough (should be 45 to 60 minutes) even for a medium load and all our clothes were very very damp. Excellent parking and this facility is really nicely located to see the sights in and around Daytona Beach. Breakfast is typical "La Quinta Carb-a-holics" style with only hard boiled eggs for protein and a ton of bread type products. The coffee at this location was awful and OLD creamer packets. The Half & Half was gone.
UR123299194	We arrived at the La Quinta for Spring Break 2011 after leaving another hotel down the street. This hotel was a huge relief after where we had just came from. The lobby area was clean and modern with the granite countertops and ceramic flooring. They had a TV at the desk which showed pictures of the rooms and hotel grounds. The room was clean and in order, however throughout our stay we realized that the carpeting around the beds were dirty and in dire need of cleaning. The rest of the flooring is ceramic. The beds were comfortable and the couch folded out to a full size bed, which offered us additional sleeping options. Our room was right beside the elevator and stairway, yet we were hardly bothered with noise. The drain in the bathtub got clogged and wouldn't drain at all, we made a call to the front desk and they sent someone up with Drano, when that didn't work they sent the maintenance man to fix it, and all was well. The pool are was nice and relaxing, along with the hot tub. They had staff on site all the time cleaning the parking lot, the pool area, and we seen the Manager about everyday walking the grounds and making sure everything was in order. I would definitely stay here again. Free parking too, but when they have a lot of guests you may have to park across the street, which is still free.
UR122321889	We loved this hotel! It was clean, beautiful, nicely decorated, updated, and well-kept...but what really makes their customer service was what really made them shine. It was impeccable! From the night clerks to the day clerks to the management to the house and ground keepers, everyone was warm and friendly, corteous and helpful. In todayls society, I found it nothing short of astounding how nicely we were treated. Our first room was a nice, spacious room with a king and beautiful updated bathroom and vanity for only $89/ night. They allowed our 2 mini dashunds and didn't cahrge a pet fee. Unfortunately, the toilet didn't flush, but that happens, I didn't get the impression it was due to poor maintenance. They didn't have any other 2nd floor rooms with king size beds and I don't care for 1st floor rooms in any hotel near an ocean cause they always smell musty to me, so they upgraded us to the biggest oceanfront room in the hotel! It had 2 queens, a fridge, microwave, pull out couch, balcony over the pool, and a stunning ocean view. Very nice tile flooring, black granite-looking vanity and shower walls, beautiful gold duvet bedspreads, and nice sized flat screen tv (which we didn't watch, but woulve been nice if we had). The room we were in is normally $134/night. The nexy day the toilet was fixed in the original room and we enquired about whether we'd have to pay full price to stay in the oceanfront suite. The manager allowed us to stay in his nicest room for $99/night the rest of our stay, which I thought was more than fair. The continental breakfast is not extraordinary, but its not bad. You can make yourself waffles and there are decent pastries, cereal, bagels, and toast. There is also coffee and juice. For pet owners- when you arrive they make you sign a pet policy that is pretty intimidating. Don't let that scare you off! It says you can't leave them unattended in the room, which is completely impractical bc pets are not allowed on the beach, in restaurants, or shops and Daytona is way too hot to leave your pets in the car. So I asked the manager about it and he said it is not strictly enforced, but they must have to a policy in place bc they've had problems in the past with dogs who barked so incessantly that it disturbed other guests. So, in short, you can leave your dogs in the room unattended, but you must use the "do not disturb" sign so housekeeping knows and you are required to provide your cell # in case they get complaints about your dog. If your dogs begin to disrupt other guests, you are expected to come back to the hotel. We had no problems whatsoever! We pulled the curtain so our dogs wouldn't bark at people walking by and we asked housekeeping to clean our rooms when we took our dogs for a walk in the morning. They were very accomodating. There is not a lot of grass available for dogs to go potty, so we walked them to the nearest landscaped areas around the hotel. We didn't get a single dirty look from staff, but we were also very respectful and picked up behind our dogs like civilized people ought to do. Last, but not least, I should mention there is limited parking. If you arrive later in the evening, you will have to park in the lot across the street. We are a young couple so that wasn't the end of the world for us. But for older people or couples with young kids, it might be annoying. Overall, I am extremely impressed with La Quinta. My sister and her hubby also stayed there and after having problems with the hot water and the dead bolt, they were upgraded to an oceanfront room for free. The hotel goes above and beyond to make their guests happy and that is why I wouldny hesitate to return there!
UR122308006	Stayed here on our way to New Orleans. This used to be another type of hotel/motel, not the usual La Quinta building. All I can say is that it is beach front, breakfast was decent. You get what you pay for. Fortunately, we used my husband's points, otherwise we would have left.
UR121476158	We went to Daytona Beach for a basketball game at the Ocean Center arena last weekend and booked in at this La Quinta because we knew they would allow us to bring our dog for no additional fee. We were able to walk to and from the Ocean Center from this hotel as it is just under a mile and a straight shot down the road. Our dog is not a "barker", so we felt confident we could leave her in the room with no problems. Unlike a previous poster, we specifically asked the front desk staff about leaving her alone and they said that would be fine, and just asked us for our cell number in case a problem arose. We did sign a "pet agreement" agreeing to be responsible for any possible damages. We even got a welcome packet with several goodies when we checked in with lotion, chips, water, etc.(we are rewards members which you can join for free). The front desk staff could not have been more polite, courteous, and helpful. They gave me directions, recommendations, and promptly assisted me when I accidently locked myself out of my room. :-( We originally booked for a ground floor city view room, but were able to upgrade to an oceanfront room for only $20. more. I did glance into one of the city view rooms when the door was open while they cleaned it, and they looked much smaller. They offered to give us a 2nd or 3rd floor room, but we opted to stay on the ground floor oceanfront since we had the dog. The room was large with nice tile and granite countertops. The sink was outside the bathroom and we had a fridge, microwave, beautiful view of the ocean, comfortable bed, flatscreen lcd hd tv, inroom safe, iron, coffeemaker and hairdryer. The bathroom had a nice tub and good adjustable showerhead. The 2nd and 3rd floor oceanfront rooms have balconies and the groundfloor a patio area which you can access from your room. The area is landscaped very nicely with a fountain, small grassy area, and tables and chairs. The signs say "no dogs on the grass", but we did let our dog sit with us on the concrete at the tables and chairs that night with no problems. Beside the patio and grassy area is an enclosed pool area that looked nice, but was a little too chilly for us to enjoy. We could see the ocean just fine from our room, too, even though it was on the ground floor. There are stairs that you can walk down to access the beach, but we just enjoyed the gorgeous view from the outside patio area with our bottle of wine and our dog on her leash. I noticed (as another poster did) that there are several cameras in the pool and patio area and some are aimed at the balconies, so do keep your curtins pulled for privacy. I do understand why they have these cameras as Daytona Beach has a reputation for being a place where students and bikers may drink and party and accidents can happen. Unfortunately, too many students have fallen from hotel balconies in Daytona during spring break. I know all the cruise ships have cameras everywhere, too, including pointing at the balconies, but that isn't going to stop me from enjoying myself. One poster also mentioned a lack of place to walk your dog, but there is currently a vacant lot beside the La Quinta in the front with grass where you can walk your dog with no problems. We were able to park our car (free parking) right outside the room which was convenient. The hotel has complimentary copies of USA today in the lobby on weekdays and there is free wireless internet that worked fine after we entered the user id and password that the front desk gave us. There is also a small business center beside the breakfast area that has a desktop computer that you can use for free if you don't have a laptop with you. A printer is attached, but there is an additional fee of $1.00 per page if you need to print anything. The ice machine I used on the ground floor worked with no issues. You get the ice out by sticking your room key in the machine to activate it. Breakfast was fine...cereal, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, juices, hard boiled eggs, waffle maker, muffins, toast, etc. We paid $82.10 for our upgrade to an oceanfront room (low season rates) and booked directly through the La Quinta site. We have stayed at a lot of La Quintas since they allow pets, but this one was especially nice being right on the beach. I would stay here again in a heartbeat (and hope to come back) and pay a few extra bucks for the larger very nice oceanfront room.
UR120630302	Came here with my boyfriends parents for the Bethune Cookman Homecoming and it was magnificent! The front desk area was very nice a spacious, the clerk was also very nice. And the rooms were very welcoming. Big beds, bathroom was big, had a sort of sweet smell to it that I liked. The only thing I didnt like was the fact there were no elevators (seeing as we were on the top floor) and no type of activities other than the beach. But its a great hotel for its price. Theres a nice little patio area just a walk away from the room and the beach is just a few steps from the patio. Very nice.
UR120112782	We stayed here on the third floor at the far end of teh building near the property border for four days in early November 2011. From the outside this beachside hotel is beautiful, and the pool/hottub area, lounge courtyard, and breakfast buffet area is very lovely. Even the prices are decent. The balconies offer a magnificent view of the beach and ocean. In general, the rooms are clean and elegantly furnished - some have a dark wood style and others (like ours) was done in a white stone style that makes you think of old Rome or Greece. Our room also had a nice stone two-person sauna bath in the middle of the room. So why then wouldn't I stay here again? It isn't because they installed the sink and shower faucets the wrong way so that when you turn on the cold water you get scalded with hot water. Mistakes happen. It isn't because we had to ask twice for an alarm clock and toilet paper for our room and finally had to go down to the front desk to get one. Mistakes happen. It is because, after a couple of nights I was standing on the balcony and listening to the rushing of the waves under a beautiful starry sky when I suddenly noticed a large white pole sticking up among the trees and plants of the garden. At the top of the pole was something that had a small ring of tiny red lights on it. It really startled me. I looked down the length of the building and noticed two more such poles with little red lights. But since I couldn't see it clearly in the dark I decided to wait until morning to check it out. The next morning i discovered that it was exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be - video cameras! And one of them was aimed right at our balcony looking into our third-floor room! (SEE MY PHOTO). Conveniently the bed is situated right in front of the balcony. I can understand a camera facing the parking lot, front office and even the pool area - but aimed into the back of our room?! To me that is crossing the line between security and peeping tom! I plan on calling my attorney about the legality of this when I have a chance, and I also plan to notify the local press. So unless you are a voyeur and enjoy having your every move video taped in your hotel room, I'd avoid this place like the plague.
UR120091200	We stayed here a few nights and the rooms were decent and clean for the price we got. We would stay again if we come back to visit mom who lives in Ormond Beach right next door.
UR120075917	This cute little hotel is right on the beach and is not very expensive. The room was nice, with a wonderful tiled floor, nice bathroom and was very spacious, again, for the price (under $100). It is on the upper end of the beach, away from the boardwalk, but near to many excellent restaurants and attractions. We really enjoyed it.
UR119829003	My father and I stayed at this hotel on our 2nd night of driving from Minnesota to central Florida. We didn't have a reservation and I have usually had pretty positive experiences at LaQuinta so we gave it a try. I was able to receive a decent AAA rate for the room, we were in room 308 which had a sitting area with fridge, micro, sofa, coffee table and TV. Through an archway were the 2 beds, another TV, dresser, desk, closet and balcony overlooking the pool area and beach. The room was very clean and had tile flooring (I wish more hotels did this instead of dirty carpets). The room appears to have been refreshed fairly recently - the bed and bedding was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The sink is out side of the bathroom, which is nice when traveling with multiple people. The hotel offered your basic run of the mill breakfast - fruit, cereal, waffle maker, etc. Some of the common areas (vending areas) and elevator appeared to be a bit run down. The pool area was nice and the walkway to the beach was very convenient. As for noise, we really didn't notice anything, we kept our patio door open all night to listen to the waves which probably helped drown out any noise there may have been - with the exception of the neighbors who returned to their room at 4:00 am whooping and hollering on their balcony, but it was very short lived and I fell right back asleep. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again.
UR118391445	My review is based on the "pet friendlieness" motto this hotel claims to have. My husband and I always stay at La Quinta Inns while traveling with our 2 very small Maltese dogs and until now, our experiences have been wonderful. After checking in to our 2 room "suite" i noticed that there were MANY small improvements that could be made. The furniture was in disrepair, 2 of the lights were not working, there was an odd smell in the room, and the door separating the 2 bedrooms was in terrible condition. The bottom of it was dirty and it had several places where spots had been repainted. The main door latch was also broken. We then decided to take our dogs out to potty and soon realized they were not allowed in the only grassy area on the entire property. I can understand not wanting pets near the pool area, but at a PET FRIENDLY hotel you would think they would have some designated place to use as a dog walk area. When I inquired at the front desk i was very nicely told that the only place available was a postage stamp sized landscaped area in front of the hotel, right on the street behind the welcome sign... While inside i noticed the LONG list of pet policies this hotel has; none of which are posted on their website. Apparently they reserve the right to charge you $100 per complaint they receive about your pet. Pretty friendly, huh? The location of this hotel and the pool and beach access are great, but I would not return even without my dogs. Their only saving grace was that we were only staying 1 night and due to a promo only paid $77 plus taxes. I absolutely would not recommend this place if you are traveling with pets!
UR116762881	Very nice, clean rooms. Staff was friendly. Beds were very comfortable. After having a bad experience on the first night of our vacation at a different hotel we dicided to check out and find somewhere else to stay. The La Quina Inn and Suites Daytona Beach saved our vacation. We will go back.
UR116403681	We had a great two night stay in an ocean front room 213 on the second floor. The view was priceless. The rooms are nice and updated. Our room was clean upon arrival. Housekeeping staff, a young man and young lady were freindly and helpful. Yes, parking is a bit tight if you drive a truck. The front office staff was friendly upon check in and check out. The pool was clean and clear. This hotel is dog friendly, but requires you to sign a pet contract and request you not leave your pet alone in your room. Be aware that the Daytona beaches do not allow dogs. The location is within walking distance of the pier and the restaraunts and the shopping areas.
UR115873244	Everything was awesome.Best hotel in daytona beach.
UR115340197	We drove from Clearwater Beach to Daytona Beach and stopped at the first "large chain" hotel. Walked into a room that smelled like dog pee. Had a used bar of soap left on the sink. For $149 / night, we paid for a comfortable bed and a beautiful view, not anything else.
UR115227869	We were disappointed with this hotel this year. Have stayed here for 6 years, and have been happy. but this year there were problems: - ice machines not working - no hot water during stay - dryers in laundry are inefficient and you pay twice as much to dry clothes - parking is limited, with not enough space for all guests - management was unresponsive to our needs - breakfast is sparse and there is little room for guests General Manager advises that the ice and hot water problems are now resolved. Positive: rooms are good sized and reasonably priced; great oceanfront views and access; nice pool and lawn area; only 5 blocks from Oceanwalk.
UR115222314	My family & I have been staying here every year for five years now. It is a great location, walk on beach or street is five blocks to the Oceanwalk shops & entertainment. Eating @ Hog Heaven is one of our family must haves while here. The food is great, but don't be surprised if your waitstaff never smiles at you. The rooms here are nice and they are pet friendly.(very little grass for potty time) I like being able to do laundry onsite. The breakfast is only so-so, but you have a Burger King by Oceanwalk. This trip was for our families annual trip to Daytona International Speedway Coke race and July 4th holiday. On arrival we were thankful to be able to upgrade to an Oceanfront Suite seeing as we had a three week old grandson with us. The room was pretty clean, but many of our towels looked like my car cleaning rags. The trash cans on property were always overly full with garbage sitting around them. We bought ant traps for our patio area. None of the 3 ice machines had ice. We went a full two days without the luxury of warm or hot water. The only other issue of this property, never seems to be enough parking and sometimes you have to park across the street and it does not appear secure. We received an apology from the General Manager telling us that all of these issues have been resolved or will be soon. I am not sure if we will go back to find out, but we have really enjoyed the four year previously spent at this property. If it were just me and my husband, I would probably give them another chance. Great location if you don't want to be driving around Daytona Beach. Walking at night is very nice, safe and much cooler than daytime,lol.

UR115067451	Hotel very nice. There is a pool and hot tub area and it is right on the beach and the beach was clean. We were close to everything. The wifi was free but was very patchy in some places. DISLIKES: The cleaning people dont speak english very well and we had a very hard time getting them to understand that we did or did not need something when they asked and they were very consistant until you just said "okay, go ahead". Our room had a kitchen set (fridge, microwave, sink, cabinets..etc.) but did not come with any plates, forks, napkins. Our shower lost pressure on the 4th day and no one knew why. Overall our experience was good though because we were very close to shops, gas stations, stores, and the pier with rides on it. Would come back;.
UR114612026	This a 2/2.5 star location so expectations should not be high. Nonetheless, it's located on the beach and within walking distance of the boardwalk which was great. My husband, daughter and I stayed on the 2nd floor in a standard room during the week. The amenities were basic (soap, shampoo, fridge, microwave and daily room cleaning services). Parking is free for one car per room, but they will make an exception during non busy times if you have more than one car. The pool is nice and kid friendly. Breakfast includes a waffle maker, cold cereal, oatmeal packets, boiled eggs, fruit and pastries w/coffee and juice...pretty decent. Overall the experience was nice, staff was friendly and you can't really beat the price for a chain hotel/motel/inn on the beach so close to the boardwalk activities.
UR114186767	We just returned from our stay at this hotel. We had a great time. We had the Ocean front family suite. The view was beautiful. We also had our small dog. I was a bit worried about where we could walk her after reading posts here. I am glad I went ahead and stayed there. We walked her in the back grassy area next to the pool, as did many others and nothing was said. We even got brave and took her down to the beach for just a few min after seeing others do it..... she loved it! Our room was nothing fancy, but it's all we needed. It was very clean, beds and pillows were comfy. We couldn't ask for a better stay. I never had a problem getting the extra towels we needed, but I did walk to the front desk myself to ask for and pick up. After working in a hotel myself I know that there is usually only 1 front desk staff on duty to tend to all guests, answering/transferring calls, and taking reservations. They get quite busy, are human themselves, and forget sometimes just like you! Just get up and go pick it up yourselves.... the exercise will be good for you!!!
UR114059280	We picked the LaQuinta because of the Brand. A little hesitate because it was pet friendly and I had a bad experience with another hotel brand, but was pleasantly surprise. The view was awesome. Coming from NC first visit to Florida was surprised to see cars park right on the beach :) The breakfast area was small and the staff was great but keep in mind they truly give you only enough towels for how ever many guests you have when you make reservations. I had reserved a DOUBLE SUITE and they only gave me enough towels for 1 person and when asked the front desk for more I never got them.
UR113651357	Brought some freinds to Daytona Beach for there first visit and we stayed at this property. They had never stayed at any Laquinta Inn before and absoutely loved it!! Ajay and his staff was great. The rooms as always were fresh and clean. This property is great and even though there may be more properties around this once is the cleanest!!
UR110561008	We had two rooms at this hotel. Both had been newly renovated. They were very clean. We loved the pool and easy beach access. The breakfast was great! We felt very comfortable and safe there. We would stay there again and again. The only thing we didn't like was that we had to park across the street and walk over. That wouldn't prevent us from staying there though just a minor inconvenience.
UR107958276	Dirty stained towels, broken railings on the second floor, ice machine 3 feet from our door. And then the fire alarm went off at midnight- and they didn't know how to shut it off. Went off for over 30 minutes. Ended up getting 5 hours of sleep (maybe) and found a better hotel the next day.
UR107665258	In my opinion your belongings are not safe and secure at this location regardless of said security issues. THEFTS ARE VERY COMMON IN THE DAYTONA AREA IN GENERAL PER THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
UR103109231	I showed up well before check in time and, although my room was not ready, was allowed to leave my car there and enjoy the pool while I waited. I stayed there for two nights and was able to enjoy the free breakfast (toast, cereal, waffles) one morning. Although I came in just before it ended everything still seemed to be well stocked. The room was spotless, the wireless internet worked quite well (even by the pool) and the property seemed well maintained. Was able to enjoy the pool quite a bit as well as the direct beach access. A leisurely 15 minute walk along the beach takes you to the main boardwalk with the various shops and rides. Overall, an enjoyable stay.
UR92610241	Was headed south and needed aplace to rest for a night or two - having cats with me I usally look at laquinta because of their friendly pet policy- I called first and they gave me a roomsaver rate - when I got their the streets were deserted and quiet- 10pm upon arriving at the hotel I was a bit skeptical because it is only 3 floors compared to the towering hotels in the neighborhood- I asked if she could put me on the oceanfront side for the same rate - being that there were very few people there and I would probably stay 2 nights minimum- she did - it was very nice - the only downside was I was next to the elevator so a little noise - rrom was redone and nice - flt screen and fresh paint - nice granite bathroom tops - nice touch- mostly tiled which is nice being on the beach allowing animals- breakfast was served till 10 am - ok - typical - staff very nice and pleasant - for the price I paid to be right on the ocean great deal - would go back - no hilton but definetly worth the price-
UR85260704	1. Upon arrival and check in we were informed that the elevator was broken and I was with a handicapped guest. We both had to walk up 3 flights of stairs with coolers, and baggage at least five 5 times. It took at least 4 hours for the repair to be complete and again my guest had multiple leg and back surgeries and walking up and down stairs was very painful so he did not leave the room what a way to start a vacation! No one at hotel offered to help the handicapped guest and they knew he was handicapped because they provided a handicapped space and placard for his car window. 2. Next incident was when the pool was treated with chemicals at 12 o’clock on a Sunday afternoon. All the guest were told to get out of the pool for at least 30 minutes. Some kids did not get out fast enough so the pool attendant screamed at the kids. I reported to this to the Manager and he said he is not on his staff and cannot tell him when to clean pool. I said he should suggest he come during the week and he dismissed me. 3. Our car was broken into and $200 in cash was taken along with some tools. We were not aware of the theft until we got back home so it was not reported. 4. A drunk was allowed to eat breakfast in the lobby 2 days that I was there. He continually fell asleep with his head almost landed in his food at least a dozen times, this was not a family friendly situation. He also wasted a tremendous amount of food each day, I am talking about 5 doughnuts, 8 boiled eggs, several juices, 2 coffees and many bowls of cereal. I did report this to the front desk and they said “again??” This front desk clerk was there that day and have a clear view of the man. He also later hung out by the pool with even more food in white Styrofoam plates and bowls so I assume it was from the breakfast area. I know he was not a guest because I saw him walk out of the lobby the first day and not be there all day then he showed up the next morning in the same clothes. He had no room key, appeared disheveled and certainly not able to afford a room at this hotel. 5. Another item in disrepair was the ice machine, I reported this early in my stay and it was never fixed. Even with all these problems when I asked for a discount and I was given 20 or 30 dollars off my bill. I decided to answer this survey when I saw on the website that there was a 100% guarantee or your night is free. Well I never received a free night and I think it was more then justified.
UR83691261	This hotel is NOT pet-friendly. There is NOWHERE to walk your pet.They direct to a 4 x4 area out front of the hotel 3 feet from a 6 lane hiway. There is a large area of grass in the back,but your NOT allowed to walk your dog there.This hotel should not allow pets. Kelly from nc.
UR77708361	I stayed one night here with my husband due to a business meeting with my company and my boss booked this hotel. I have stayed at several other hotels in Daytona and to me this was the best hotel. There are more expensive hotels with all the bells and whistles then there are dumps at very cheap prices. This hotel is right in the middle and to me that is a good thing. The hotel is only 3 story's high. I can't stand the other higher hotels in the area! It means more people, more trouble, more headaches! I wanted a balcony room but we ended up on the bottom floor due to king jacuzzi room and after getting settled in, I would have rather had the bottom floor than the balcony! We were only a few steps away from the outside sitting area, pool and beach. Now if you perfer the balcony thats fine you can take the elevator or stairs all day long, but to just walk out the sliding door and walk out onto everything I found more relaxing. This is not a crowed hotel and personel or the manager is constantly walking around making sure everything and everyone is ok. (yes I said manager - which i find comforting than the normal stay behind my desk manager) The reviews I have read are true to form. There are a few glitches while staying here, but no hotel is perfect as some snooty people want them to be and no one for that matter is perfect either. My only problem I had staying there and again this is being on the bottom floor, was some idiot on the third floor decided to toss out old coffee and it landed on me. Prompt superman speed from the front desk and manager the problem was taken care of. The morning breakfast was plentyfull, I took mine back to my room and no one said anything. The maid was nice when she was cleaning another room and I asked for extra coffee cups. Everything worked in the room, did not have a problem with seeing any bugs, dead remote batteries, dirty sheets, cold water, and other misc compalints people write about. I too loved the grass area right outside my door, I walked around bare footed majority of the time, because i felt safe, there was always maintance man walking around picking up after everyone. Keeping the grounds in order. The neat things I noticed about the hotel was there is a outside shower to get all the sand off you before you came back up the stairs to the outside sitting area, also the kiddie pool has a fountain shower I saw all the kids giggle and having a good time in and the ice machines....there isn't anyone coming on that property to take ice that isn't a guest..lol..because it takes your room key to use the ice machine ;) The front desk does have camaras and they are constantly watching the outside area so if people are horse playing around or disturbing other people, security is prompt to go outside and check things out. I felt very secure here. I had such a relaxing time, shame was only for the night, but I will go back again with no hesitations. ohh, and the Saturday night fireworks were neat to watch. My only other complaint which is just personal with me is its not central air, and only option is the turn knobs for low cool or high cool (or heat) so I never knew what the tempreture was. I am a hot natured person and even with the bed next to the AC blowing on me, I was still a little un comfortable, but again that is just me, because my husband was freezing and other guests had their sliding doors open enjoying the cool beach breeze. But, I felt I needed to mention this, incase there are other hot natured people out there. All and all I give this small quant hotel 2 thumbs up for everything was "nearly perfect" except for my surprise morning cup of coffee.
UR70081593	Great location clean room great security. Very friendly staff.
UR69925764	We were invited guests of a business colleague of my husband for this past 4th of July weekend, and as a last resort he booked everyone's rooms at this hotel; because there were none to be had due to the Daytona races and 4th of July holiday. The hotel is old, but the room we had was clean. However, the toilet wouldn't flush properly; took 3-4 attempts to just flush it completely. The first day we were 'walked in on' twice within a couple of hours. The first time was a housecleaning person who wouldn't make eye contact when I asked her why she just walked in our locked room. She never gave me an answer. The second was a hotel staff person saying he had a complaint about the nightstand being broken. I told him that we'd only been there for a couple of hours and he was the second person to just walk in unannounced; oh, and no there was no problem with the nightstand. He apologized at least and said the front desk didn't have us as "checked in" yet. The first morning we were greeted with a stern warning letter on our windshield that our car would be towed because we were not registered guests. We registered our license plate number and car when we checked in. We took the letter to the front desk and she just blew it off with a sorry, no problem attitude. Second day we were told by our colleagues who booked the rooms (over $5,000,00 worth of rooms by the way) that the manager had banged on their door and told them they had to vacate their two suites because they were being moved to less expensive rooms. When he explained that these suites were booked and paid for thru the weekend, the manager basically called him a liar and said he was forcing them all to move because he'd booked someone else in these suites. Then he proceeded to bang on the door of the other suite where people were sleeping and when they answered the door he said to get out. Needless to say our colleagues left the hotel completely. And then called us to warn us of what happened and that there shouldn't be a problem with our room; but to let them know if there was. That afternoon we were lounging in our room, reading, because is was raining. We had the sliding door open for fresh air and the same manager was suddenly standing outside our sliding door yelling, 'hello, hello!' When we asked him what he wanted, he lectured us on leaving the door unlocked when we weren't in the room. Odd, because we were IN the room at the time and we informed him nicely that we weren't idiots and wouldn't leave a sliding door unlocked if weren't there. (even though two of his employees found it necessary to just walk into our locked room with the master key without knocking....). When the rain stopped, we went out onto the patio to relax but it was still windy from the passing storms. A beer bottle blew off of one of the balconies and shattered. Since there were children still running from the pool to the beach barefoot, I called the front desk to report the shattered bottle. The manager was rude and showed up at our room again giving us the 3rd degree on how it fell, whose was it, where did it come from, etc... Instead of cleaning up the mess he was trying to accuse us or anyone he could find for breaking the bottle. After 4 different barefoot kids ran through the glass, he finally stopped the inquisition and started sweeping up the glass. For the ridiculous rate (jacked up for the holiday I'm sure) of $289 a night that our colleague had paid for our basic room - we would gladly stay anywhere but this place with the Gestapo front desk manager to contend with.
UR68457677	I've stayed at a number of motels and hotels in Daytona Beach. I've had some with cockroaches in the bathroom at night and some with air-conditioners that have sounded like helicopters. There have also been some motels that smell awful, have dirty carpet, etc. I will never return to those places. We found this little gem when we got a coupon from the highway motels coupon book that you can get at the visitor center. They were asking $79 per night with the coupon. The room had very attractive furnishings, a Spanish-style tile floor, and was clean. The A/C was reasonably quiet. The room was very spacious. They had free Wi-Fi that I was easily able to access. They also had a nice breakfast. I will return to this place on my next visit to Daytona Beach.
UR64302907	We only stayed one night and paid for beach facing room...I thought it was clean and lovely. What more can I say really...compared to where we were staying in Orlando this was a welcome escape even if it was only 1 nights
UR60255081	Great Weekend, beautiful landscaping, right on the beach. Fantastic attentive employees. Clean rooms and excellence maintenance. We had a great weekend. Thanks so much.
UR59173880	The staff was very friendly, They got us into our room very quickly, The room was clean, When we needed more towels they were quick to respond.. But we noticed there was burn marks on the padding of the bed and burn marks on the sofa...Late at night there is alot of people hanging around the hotel which REALLY brothers me... This hotel is in a high crime area.......
UR58965425	The room was dirty and smelly. We left and went to the Holiday Inn down the street (very nice Holiday in with outsanding staff). A few days later our travel agent told us that the La Quinta manager told him we were still there. We went back to speak with the manager and he said that he wouldn't tell the travel agency we left until we "proved that the room was dirty." When we went to the room (he didn't even have to ask which room it was), and it had been thoroughly cleaned and would have passed a military inspection (I spent 20-years in the military, so I should know). When I stated that the room had been cleaned, he said that the room hadn't been touched and that we were lying. When trying to get a refund from the travel agency and La Quinta, the manager wouldn't agree to tell them that we left the property unless we agreed to say that the room was not dirty/smelly. Even though La Quinta (corporate, not this property's manager) finally gave us a refund (weeks later), the attitude and behavior of the manager was unexusable and we will never go to this property again. I would go back to tent city in SWA before I would go back to this place.
UR55593422	Everything about this hotel was super. The housekeeping staff was awesome. If we ever get a chance to go back to Daytona Beach we will stay there again.
UR46402359	Our family of four stayed here in August for a week. One of the few upsides to this stay was that we redeemed La Quinta points and our stay was reasonably cheap. However, I was charged $10 per person per night for my two 18 year old sons, which I think is ridiculous. I'm not sure if this is LQ policy, or just this hotels policy. It seems ridiculous to me to have to pay extra for a family member. My kids just turned 18, this was their graduation present, and they still live under my roof. Rooms - The "two room" rooms are exactly that, two rooms. One room w/beds in it and one room w/tv & couch in it. In my conversation with the hotel prior to our arrival, I was led to believe it was a "two bedroom" room, a bed in each room and a seperate room for tv/couch. Cleanliness - The closet had a moldy/musty smell. We were afraid to hang our clothes in it for fear they would absorb the smell. We had a no-smoking room and it was fine the first few days, but after about the third day it started smelling like stale smoke. We realized the rooms were "cleaned" very strongly between guests and the cleaning solutions were wearing off and the true odor of the room was coming out by this time. Facilities-they have two washers and two dryers at this hotel. One washer was "out of order" the entire week we were there. The "workout room" is a joke. It also had a "out of order" sign on the door the entire week we were there. Obviously it had been that way for a while and would most likely continue to be.....there was sheetrock, ladders, saws and lots of other construction supplies stored in there. The "workout room" should instead be labeled "supply room". As others have posted, you are being watched. They have cameras all over the property and will call your room if they see you doing something they percieve as "wrong". I drive a 4 door truck and was limited to certain parking spaces in their very small lot. One afternoon we made a fast run back to our room from shopping and were leaving again within 5 minutes and the front desk called to tell me I needed to move my truck as I was "in the way". This really set me off as it was the middle of the afternoon when the parking lot was mostly empty as everyone is out sight seeing. I was parked legally in front of my room, but they perceived this as "wrong" because my truck is larger than most of the other cars in the parking lot. I try to be courteous, and was not "in the way" as they said. I made sure of this before we got out of the truck. As there are only balconies on the rooms that face the ocean, lots of the guests would set their lawn chairs up and hang out in front of their rooms in the walk ways. Beer bottles and pizza boxes were usually found in the walkways in the morning. It is definitely not a 5 star hotel. Housekeeping - they were great. Gave you anything you needed. Location - definitely not in the middle of everything. This could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. We had to drive everywhere we went. Breakfast - suprisingly decent. No meat of any kind, but an ample supply of pastries, cereal, fruit, breads. Nothing to get too excited about, but I've seen worse. Often times had to wait for desk clerk to replenish. Upkeep - I did not see anyone doing any sort of maintenance on the hotel at any time during our stay. The parking lot was never washed off/swept up. The washer in the laundry room was never repaired. The balcony railings on the ocean side were in need of painting. They did not enforce the "no dogs in this area" rule (dogs were on the patio and using the grassy area nearby for their potty). I am a dog lover, but am not a friend of their poop in the grass :) Management - manager hides behind wall at front desk watching his cameras and lets employees handle disgruntled guests. After the guest leaves the room, the manager will walk out from behind the wall and talk about the guest to the employee. I saw this on more than one occasion as we were eating breakfast . Overall, Daytona Beach was a great place and we had a good time. We decided not to let the negativity of this hotel get us down. I will never go back there, and will never recommend it. We usually have good luck with La Quintas. This one needs to have it's franchise revoked. It brings down the La Quinta name. Having a different owner/manager would help improve it.
UR46373442	Room was recently renovated and very clean compared to similarly priced hotels nearby. Beach was right out the balcony, jacuzzi tub in room was relaxing, and staff was hospitable. Only slight drawback is that right across the street is a liquor store that had a lot of foot traffic into it late at night, including some scary looking characters. None were on the hotel property at all, just across the street, but I still escorted wife to parking lot after dark for safety sake. Hotel itself was clean, and affordable - a great value!
UR45740714	This hotel was more than what we expected. It was worth a stay, to stay at this LaQuinta Inn, which is oceanfront. We had a great view of the ocean, from the balcony to sit out on, even on the ground floor, just steps away from the beach. We were amazed. Room had tile and carpet in the room, also smelled so fresh and tiles looked so clean. Bed was extremely comfortable, room was clean and view was outstanding. The hotel had a breakfast, which was great!! This hotel is dog friendly free up to 20 pounds and $10 a night over 20 pounds. This hotel is close to the Daytona International Speedway. The only thing we seen of a problem is the parking, which is somewhat limited. We were so please, all staff was so courteous and friendly. We will go back again and recommend everyone with children to try this hotel.
UR42469800	Had a wonderful time, our stay was just a one nighter. Checked in at 2pm and had plenty of time to enjoy the wonderful pool, and beach. Bed was extremely comfortable, room was clean and view was outstanding. We stayed in a King Suite with jacuzzi tub and it had nice tile floor. Hotel is dog friendly free up to 20 pounds and $10 a night over 20 pounds. Beach is not dog friendly but may change, Ponce Inlet does have a great dog friendly beach. Overall great experience, not sure what other people are talking about.
UR36728094	Just an old hotel with a few renovations, felt dirty (although it was clean), just felt nasty. We checked out after being there for 2 hours and seeing a mom watch a child go to the bathroom and then try to empty his pants into the pool. Just the whole thing was a bad experience. The room was clean, but smelled and the linens were limp and we just couldn't imagine sleeping there. Just left you feeling like you wanted to go home and stay there, which is exactly what we did. True we arrived without reservations anywhere and they had plenty of rooms, no wonder. LOL.
UR36373389	This hotel was more than what we expected. It was worth a stay, to stay at LaQuinta. We had checked in at another hotel, which price was very high and rooms were from the 70s. While walking on the beach, we had a glance at this hotel from the back and decides to take a look at it. Pool was zero entry, were kids can play by themselves. As soon as we walked into front office, it had actual pictures of the room so we did not have to go to the room to see it. But we were curious, therefore dicided to take a look at the room. Manager took a tour with us and showed us all different options we had. It was something we had not seen before. Room had tile and carpet in the room, also smelled so fresh and tiles looked so clean. Had a great view of the ocean, as well a balcony to sit out on. We were amazed. At that point, we decided to check-out from the hotel we stayed at and stay at LaQuinta. We were so please, all staff was so courteous and friendly. We will go back again and recommend everyone with children to try this hotel.
UR36077751	I personally would not choose to stay here again... and I am not very complicated, nor am I hard to please hotel wise. None of the employees too friendly (not rude but not happy to help either)...the room was just okay ( i would say hampton inn a step up), the breakfast in the morning decent (but never enough tables...people standing waiting to sit all the time), extererior corridors. Pool area has NO lights at all (I can understand around the perimeter of it as it may bother pool front rooms, but none in the water either...pool area totally dark after dark. The pillow top beds were no better than anywhere else. When got up at night, and turned on the bathroom light there were several roaches scurrying around. We had 2 adults and 4 kids and we stayed in a "city view" family suite. We were doing a last minute trip with my sister and the kids and were trying to do it cheaply so we agreed on $109/night for parking lot view instead 169 for a beach front. We had family meet us there and they had a pool front family suite (which was nicer- more daylight). The housekeeping I swear chain smoked from early morning til after 1 hanging out all over the parking lot (our girl was very nice though). They don't tell you that they have pool towels, but if you go ask for them you can pick some up from the front desk. The pros were that it had a zero entry pool that was warm and a small hot tub. The beach is close in (you can drive on the beach there...so you have to watch kids running from the hotel property onto the beach-but cars are only going 10 mph)....right next to hotel property on the beach is a life guard, food truck that has burgers and hot dogs and snacks, and also the icecream truck passes thru a lot. But the sand is super soft, there are no rocks in the ocean and it is all sand to as far out as you would want to go, and the ocean gradually gets deep, no drop offs. The ocean in this area is very rough, we had a ball playing in it...diving in them, boogie boarding, etc. My cousin had a 5 year old who could handle them, and mine and my sisters were ages 8 thru 12 and this is their favorite beach so far. The pros on the hotel room were that it was tiled so that it wasn't wet and sandy carpet. Our A/c broke but was fixed the next morning (we realized it too late at night), and it was just a little north of the strip section, but it was a short drive to anywhere you would want to go. If you like wings, don't miss Houligans in Ormond beach, about a 15 minute drive. It had the best wings ever, and it was a sports bar/restaurant with lots of tvs and trivia machines that you can bring to the table and the kids and adults could entertain themselves with that. Was really great food.
UR32802547	There is no way to describe how happy we were with our stay at this hotel. The room was immaculate, the staff-willing to meet our every need-nothing was out of order, the pool was beautiful, the grounds perfect. My father and my 2 children drove from Orlando on a whim and chose the La Quinta blind-it was a fantastic choice. Room 112 facing the beach on the ground floor opened to a beautiful fountain, lawn, deck, then gorgeous ocean view. The rooms were nearly soundproof, housekeeping so friendly and good, we had nooo complaints. This is a wonderful choice for family or couple--the room next door had a huge jaccuzzi tub and looked very romantic. The staff was efficient, friendly and kept the hotel running expertly. Next visit-we are returning here!
UR31736250	We njoyed our stay over there . Our room was nice, neat and clean with with all the basic things like coffee maker and complementary breakfast, internet connection, We will definately consider La Quinta again.
UR29770676	Beautiful views of the ocean. Great place to relax and enjoy time with the family. Great staff too! Nice hot breakfast. We will be back again soon.
UR29726780	Pets are allowed ( for an extra fee if over 20lbs) that is not disclosed anywhere and it is per night. Owners of hotel are everywhere and you feel like you are always being watched. I would not ever stay there again , only stayed one night then left and went to another laquinta.
UR29154387	It was a clean nice hotel, not too close but pretty close to most attractions.
UR23960242	As stated it was the Cabana...which was a total budget dump. Laquinta claims on its website that it is all new. The basic structure/room size has not changed. Renovated would be a fair statement. It was decent but we stayed during "juneteenth" and every morning our chairs (ist floor oceanfront) were gone and food was laying all over the place. Took way too long to clean up...ants everywhere as a result. We are not snotty...used to stay at the old Thunderbird, but it was a third the price so we expected shortcomings. Also, the workout room was a total joke...can't believe they act like they have one. All the cables were broken on the weight machine and one of the two aerobic units did not work. Should cost around twenty percent less...then it would be fair. Not a big deal but parking can overflow to a lot accros the street...well lit though.
UR23344054	Clean new hotel, good location, pool not heated, cold in April.
UR23120937	Thoroughly satisfied ... booked a two room suite on line at an excellent rate and found it to be exactly as represented (what some hotels claim as a "suite" is just one large room; this was a genuine 2 room suite.)The rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean! The beds were extremely comfortable and the linens and towels were first quality .. and plenty of them. The staff was pleasant and helpful. On top of it all the location directly on the bach was supurb. We plan to stay their again on our next trip to the area.
UR22150234	We have just stayed at La Quinta Daytona Beach, we found it very clean and friendly, great ocean views and would highly recommend it, we will certainly come back next year. Well done La Quinta! William
UR18045101	We have stayed at this particular hotel several times between 2003-2008 and been very satisfied. The hotel has great potential, a good location, a lovely swimming pool and is very affordable. We have, however, noticed a steady decline in both the hotel's general upkeep and customer service. The room doors are difficult to close; the toilet runs and the shower drips; paper products and cups were not replenished; a light bulb was burnt out; there were food crumbs between the bed and bedside table; there were roaches; the pay-per view television did not work; and, the complementary breakfast bar was insufficiently stocked/serviced.
UR17618615	On April 1, 2008 I registered at 816 N. Atlantic Ave., Daytona Beach, Florida location. I booked two rooms for two nights - April 1 & 2, 2008. We were given our card keys and proceeded to our rooms. My wife inserted the key into our room and it partially opened - stopped by the chain from the inside. A man, obviously shocked, yelled from the other side of the door which in turn startled my wife and I. We had to apologise for the interruption (even though this was not our mistake). My daughter and her husband opened the door to their room and it had not been made up! So, down to the desk I went and the clerk moved us to two new rooms (one of which was an upgrade to a suite). The next day we went sight seeing and when we returned to our room the card key would not work! I called the desk from our daughter's room and a new key was brought to us. Once in our room we noticed that the maid had been in and taken our used towels but didn't leave us any fresh ones. I called the desk yet again!!! New towels were brought to us. That night was probably the worst night ever spent in a hotel. Our "special upgrade" was beside the soda machine, ice machine, stairway and elevator! A horde of young people were staying at the hotel and yelled, banged, crashed and even set off fireworks from one of the hotel balconies at about 3:00 am. This was nearly heart stopping for my wife because she thought it was gun shots. We were sure that something would be done about this because the noise could be easily heard by everyone, but nothing was done!!! Beer cans, wrappers and gobs of spit were still at the entrance to, and inside of, the elevator at 9:30 in the morning. And to top it all off, for this "vacation experience" we had to pay $445.52 I am not quick to complain. I have stayed in many hotels and have never had such an unfavorable experience and have never been to the point that I had to contact the head office before. By the way, don't bother to complain to the head office for La Quinta. They will acknowledge your complaint, but that's it!
UR17315903	Walked in to the place and they were polite and allowed dogs. The big windows in each rom are a nice touch.
UR17081802	The La Quinta on Daytona Beach was a beautiful clean hotel right on the beach and close to the pier. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The price is very competitive. The pool was very nice and overlooking the beach. The only problem we had was that the air conditioner starting leaking that evening and when I contacted the front office their reply was they wouldn't have anyone available to look at it until the next day. I went back later because there was puddle of water by the bed and got towels to soak up the water. The hotel was full so there was no where else for us to go and their only offer was "I'm really sorry." The continental breakfast was very nice except the orange juice was very watered down so that it looked more like lemonade but everything else was good and the breakfast area was very clean. There was even security on the premises so you felt safe on the property. The hotel was advertised in those discount hotel books you find at rest areas and they offerred a military rate.
UR11183761	"The La Quinta Inn and Suites Daytona Beach Oceanfront is a newly built hotel "is the quote from the hotel's individual website. No way. You can see where the place has been renovated from being something else before. If not-- it is the shoddiest piece of construction I've ever seen for a hotel. The only plus here is that our 2nd floor ocean view was a beautiful view. 1) Area is scary-- I was really concerned arriving after dark. 2) Towels were all damp on the rack--yuck. Bathroom barely big enough to turn around in. 3) About a dozen dark hairs from the last bather's shampoo remained in the tub. I would not let my 7 yr old take a bath, but only a shower. 4) Front desk. while nice enough, really seemed bored to be there. 5) The light on the balcony didn't work. There was no switch to turn it on. Not on the wall inside, not on the wall outside, not on the fixture. Right... 6) The wall lights were all unplugged when we got into the room-- one couldn't even reach the only available plug. I was embarrased that I had booked this for my family and would not recommend it for a stay of longer than a day or two. I will never return to the strip here. Period. BBQ at Hogwild was awful. See food review.
UR8676891	We stayed at the La Quinta Inn because we needed a pet friendly hotel since we have small dog. We went Labor Day weekend '07. Everything was great! We had beachfront room overlooking the pool. The service and the upkeep here is excellent. Seeing how it's Daytona, we didn't expect it to be this nice and with such friendly atmosphere but it was! The housekeeping staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The only problem with this stretch of Daytona is they have their share of "riff raff" such as homeless people walking the strip on N.Atlantic. But not as bad as one would think. I really believe Daytona has gotten a bad rap because of this. Parking can be limited at the La Quinta on peak nights but they do have an over flow parking across the street which fortunately we didn't have to use.
UR8380610	We had our family reunion here the last week of July. We were all able to get oceanfront rooms next to each other on the first floor and not all of these rooms were reserved. The maid service was good, clean room and towels early in the day. The rooms were a good size, included refrigerator and microwave .Felt safe at this hotel. The beach was just a few feet from the hotel. Also had a huge patio with table and chairs, a great place to hang out at! We all agreed if we came back to Daytona Beach we would stay at the LaQuinta again.
UR7715998	This was the first time we stayed at a LaQuinta. Never again! The room smelled of mildew and the rug was wet. We stayed 2 nights. We didn't complain the first night because we thought the rug was wet because it was recently shampooed. The room smelled so bad we couldn't wait to leave.
UR5954501	This hotel was not clean, the service was horrible and the neighborhood did not seem safe. The La Quinta chain should be ashamed to have this as one of its hotels. We were there as part of a large group and by the end of the week, over half of the group checked out early and checked into other properties.
UR5461788	We stayed at this LaQuinta for the week of the Fourth of July. We were pleased to find a "newer hotel" at a reasonable rate. The hotel was very crisp and clean looking. The pool area has a mushroom type fountain that was nice to walk thru to get cooled off. However, after returning to the hotel with groceries after dinner we found there was NO PARKING. We were told by the night guard to park in the handicapped spot (still far away from our room) which we refused to do. We did park in an area in between the handicapped slots.The other nights we were forced to park across the street in a lot (unmarked) and dark and risk our lives running back across 4 lanes of traffic. When we complained the manager seemed less that concerned. Fighting for a breakfast table was another issue. We ended up standing or leaning just to eat. The worst thing is at 11:30pm we were seated on a couch in our room and proceeded to watch a mouse run back and forth across our floor. The night manager and security guard came and tried to find it, offered us another room,which we refused. We found that in the closet one of the ceiling tiles was crooked open and we think the mouse could have gotten in there,, or in gap in the bottom of the door. We packed up and left at 12:30 pm. We did get that night refunded. We had been there 3 days, no telling how many times the mouse crawled around us. I will never stay here again. The night mananger was unconcerned and NEVER apologized about the mouse.
UR5444368	Searched for a one night clean oceanfront reasonably priced hotel and found it!!! (Thanks to all the reviews written for the Daytona Beach Hotels). Oceanfront 3rd floor balcony view was awesome. The pool area was great! 5 from Ohio enjoyed the pool area, beach, close walking distance to Oceanwalk shops and the Pier. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all. We wish we could have stayed longer. We have stayed at many hotels/resorts and this was a memorable experience.
UR5326678	We were fortunate to find a room in this hotel for 2 nights in April of 2006. It was a very good experience. We were surprised to see that our room had a Jacuzzi, which we did not deem to be necessary, but it was fun. The hotel is conveniently located and a great value for the price. It has a lovely pool right in front of the beach. It was wonderful to walk along the beach and watch the sunset. Our room was clean and the staff were friendly. Definitely we would stay there again.
UR5222905	We stayed here May 19th and were happy with our accomadations. I did not want to pay a arm and a leg for a room in Daytona so I took a chance on the LaQuinta. The room was clean and the pool area was ok. We found no problems with parking although the lot was really full by 10:00pm. I had a few complaints with the property, the water presure was low in the afternoon, and there was a long ant trail going from one side of the pool deck to the other. We did not care for Daytona beach, as it seemed run down and really nothing to do but enjoy the ocean. We walked to the Pier and Ocean walk but were not impressed at all with them. The breakfast was good the next morning(Hard boiled eggs, cereal, bagels ect), but lacked enough seating. I sat by the front desk and overheard two conversations from customers who were looking for rooms after checking into the two adjacent properties. Both said that they couldnt stay at those properties as the rooms were disgusting. One asked to see a room and booked a room imediately after seeing LaQuintas room. I filled out a survey on-line on my stay with LaQuinta and Today I got a call from the hotel manager, apoligizing for the watr pressure and ants and he assured me he had taken care of them through a exterminator and he also said they were replacing all the shower heads to help remedy the water presure. He also said he looked at the breakfast seating and added a few more tables. I was impressed with this, and would recomend this place.
UR4822909	The place is pretty. The daytime manager is terribly rude. She had no idea we checked in for another day, locked us out of our room. I've been going to Daytona all of my life so far, but will NEVER stay here again. Also, she had a real problem with honoring the internet rates.
UR4153086	I will agree with everyone else that the rooms are clean but you will find parking to be a major headache. One small lot for all of the rooms. We couldn't even park in the overflow across the street because there was some sort of school event and they took the overflow for their bus. We paid major money to stay here and couldn't park. When we tried to resolve this issue with the front desk they were rude. The clean room with ocean view and continental breakfast were okay but what good are they if you cannot park. I am still looking for a good hotel in Daytona and this is not it. I would not stay here again.
UR3985670	I knew it would be a hassle with the price and booking when I found a MUCH lower price on line at their OWN website and when I called to book the rude girl said there is NO WAY we could get a beach front room for that price.... she and I went back and forth even after I faxed her a copy of what their OWN website said. FInally at the the end of the conversation she said well if you think you can get the room for that price then try and book it but I bet we will not charge you that price. By booking the room on their OWN website we were to save $80 total for the few days...... I did confirm the reservations with a various workers over the course of the few weeks... all at the correct price and all at the upper level room like requested..... OF COURSE when we get there, not only do they have us on the first floor which I said without a doubt we did NOT want, but they had us at the other NOT CORRECT PRICE! The Kid at the counter and I went around and around, I even showed him my confirmation print out and finally got the price I was confirmed at, then of course had to go around and around for the CORRECT ROOM! It was the biggest hassle ever honestly.... I could understand if I booked the room with some other online service but I booked the room using THEIR OWN WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The room was clean and fresh feeling. There was plenty of room on the pool deck to lay out. The whole place felt very clean and kept up nicely. Besides the price fasco my only other complaint was parking! It was horrible two of the nights. There is "over flow" parking across the street in a dark unmarked parking lot. My problem with this besides it being dark and unmarked is the fact there was no need for people to park there IF the hotel's own employees that took up many spots parked there. ALSO, there were MANY construction workers working on various projects at the hotel also taking up MANY parking spots, including their work trucks, trailors and box trucks. THIS IS VERY WRONG!
UR3706847	Good for the money, especially if you upgrade to a suite as we did. Nothing fancy but a clean, pretty property and a great on-the-beach location. I was impressed with the staff and especially the day manager. Very attentive -- and we were there during the height of Spring Break! I can only imagine how lovely this place might be off-season or when it's not full of noisy teenagers. But even under difficult circumstances, the friendly staff did very nicely and gave our family a pleasant stay.
UR3689002	Once again, the reviews on TripAdvisor led me to book this location, and I was glad I did. The hotel is right on the beach, just a few blocks north of the main Daytona Beach area. There are about 80 rooms here, and about half have an ocean view, while the rest have a view of the parking lot. I didn't realize that at the time I booked (thru a big discount outfit where the only choice was a "standard" room) but I was able to get an ocean view room on check-in. The room was standard, but very clean and well maintained. Had a mini-fridge and micro,which was nice. Free breakfast is standard as well.....muffins, rolls, cereals, juice etc. Staff was quite helpful. They show free hi-speed internet on the web site, and they do have it, but it is not wi-fi. It is wired ethernet, and while cables are available at the front desk, they can be in short supply. The thing that was most unusual was the pool. It has a 10 ft mushroom in a corner in the shallow end. It is a plastic mushroom, and pool water is pumped up the stem and runs over and down the 6 ft cap, creating a 360 degree waterfall. The kids loved this waterfall effect, and as it was in the shallow end (depth 1 ft) , even the youngest could enjoy it. Looking at the car tags in the lot, there were many from out of state. And a lot of families with young kids. This is not a place that seems to attract what I would call the "after spring break" crowd. Definitely a family hotel, but if you want to party, you are only a few blocks away from that. A great beach hotel. I would definitely stay there again.
UR3424749	This is a nice, affordable hotel, right on the beach. Nothing fancy about it--no bar, restaurant, or gift shop--but the rooms are good, it's clean, no bugs, and it doesn't stink. The pool area is quite nice, looking right out over the ocean. Local restaurants and shops are a few blocks to the south. This is a great place to stay if you a looking for basic amenities at an affordable price.
UR3085950	This is a above average hotel for a beach hotel! The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were nice. And the room was always stocked with 4 towels. The only update that my room needed was a new carpet. I would definetly stay here again.
UR2321221	The newly-renovated LaQuinta Inns and Suites looks great from the outside, but has its fair share of problems on the inside. Despite being recently renovated, a new layer of paint and new carpet does little to mask the mold and mildew problems in many of the rooms. Be prepared to ask for another room, with some resistance from the staff. They seem to be struggling to keep everyone happy. Granted this place is 10 times better than most of the old motels in Daytona Beach, it still falls short of meeting the quality standards I have come to expect from a LaQuinta Inns and Suites.
UR2294344	La Quinta Inn. This is a very clean motel. The oceanfront rooms are awesome. We spent 2 nights. Price was very reasonable considering it was oceanfront with balcony. The Motel is on the Ocean. Front Desk was friendly and accomodating. They are Pet Friendly for you dog lovers. Our dogs loved it! We stayed June -04. If you love Gift Shops they are everywhere and they are walking distance of the Motel. We plan on going back next June.
UR1666696	I have going there ever since I was a little girl.Now that I have a family we go there every year except last year it was closed down and they were re-doing it.I had heard that the owner had died and it was under new management.We are planning a trip this year and I cannot find out any info on it.I was just wondering if it is still called Cabana Ocean-front or if the name had changed and if the prices were still about the same?It's always been th best deal on the beach! Any info would be much appreciated...Thanx,Julie
UR1135684	Affordable, clean and family friendly. Staff in office very nice, cleaning staff did a good job. We were comfortable. Air worked well, almost too well. Hot water at all times. Kids liked it better than the place at West Palm. We will stay again.
UR926193	Ok, not a terrible place. Real close to the clubs, which is key, liquor store is kinda close. But the overall place is broke down. I was there for a week, got room service once. Not that we expected it, but it was there. New towels and ****, came in a bag hung on your door. We made our own beds because it seemed like it was a problem for the lady. The dude who runs it, is real cool, just dont get caught ******* of the balcony like some other kid did while i was there. Real funny tho. Not the cleanist, and not the cheapest either. Seemed to be a few nicer looking places, for a little cheaper money. We paid almost 100 a night for right during spring break, although we had the efficiecty unit, which was nice cause there was extra room and a large fridge which is key. But the microwave, not needed. No ashtrays, no wonder there was burnholes everywhere. No alarm clocks. If you relaly dont care and we didnt, its an ok place to stay. Althought they bone you on parking. 1 spot per room.
UR860423	The hotel itself is not exactly 4-stars. It's set up in a U shape with 2 floors, all of them exiting to the middle parking lot area. That makes it really social, and when we went down for spring break we didnt even have to leave the balcany all night. It was better than going to a club, becuase you could chill with your buddies, drink a 30-pack, and go crazy. It was right on the beach too, and had a swimming pool. Doesnt get much better for how cheap it is
UR126887294	Singapore is an extremely expensive city. If I had paid $55 a night in somewhere like Thailand and got this quality of hotel I would have been disgusted. However, Singapore like I said is much more expensive. $55 is considered "budget hotel" and therefore you get what you pay for. Bed is pretty much a mattress on the floor, everything in the bathroom gets wet when you use it. There was some mold in the bathroom which was pretty gross. However, the location is not bad, 2 minute walk to subway where you can hop on and get all around town for a good price. If you are just looking for a place to sleep at night for a decent price it's not bad, but don't expect much!
UR125633319	Stayed for a week in Feb. The room was basic, furniture creaky, and bathroom stinky. One is prepared for stinky bathrooms in budget hotels in Singapore (although I've definitely seen better ones), but what was terrible, was that the only plug point in the room had a loose contact, resulting in audible arcing. Of the 3 lamps in the room, one was not functional. Neither problem was resolved during my stay, despite complaints. The lift was not working one day, resulting in a climb up 4 levels of stairs. Construction activity in the neighbourhood was forewarned, but the firealarm going off at 0300 hrs, was unexpected. Worse, the same went off twice again on other nights. False alarm, but couple that with the plugpoint The front desk staff were courteous. But beyond that, i guess, i should have spent the 20 Dollars extra to go to other hotels in the neighbourhood.
UR120524632	The hotel staff asks for advance for every day of ur stay wifi only available in the lobby and u can't stand there for more than 20 mins coz it's very smelly the smell of ciggrettes there is no bell boy who can carry ur luggage to the room I stayed in 3 rooms in 4 days coz the Aircon doesn't work good in all rooms the best part in this hotel is the bathroom doors doesn't lock in any of the rooms and the cupboards are broken if u keep ur bags in it it will fall apart would recommend this hotel only because of the locality and the price they offer staff is rude apart from the young Chinese guy with a cap
UR119742765	I stayed there for one night only since I was meeting my husband in Singapore for a holiday (we were coming from different countries) and my flight arrived way earlier (4pm) than his (2am the next day); I didn't want to wait at the airport due to sheer exhaustion. I wanted a really cheap accommodation since we were actually booked in a decent (though a bit more pricey) hotel for the rest of our stay in Singapore and this was just a meeting place for me and my husband anyway. However I didn't want to stay in Geylang (where all the cheap hotels are) mainly because I would be solo for a few hours and was not comfortable checking into a seedy albeit affordable hotel or inn alone (though I know SG is a safe country). Thus I had to find alternatives, and after much research I decided on Asphodel Inn. Admittedly the reviews made me a bit wary but I thought I'd suck it up for one night. After all the rates are the same as Geylang's. Getting to the hotel was a breeze; I just gave the zip code to the cab driver. I was actually surprised with the chic exterior though small lobby of the hotel. I noticed right away that it was situated in a residential area with temples beside it, and a hawker nearby which was good. I specifically requested for a double room on one of the top floors AWAY from the elevators or groups since I read in the reviews that the walls were too thin and you wouldn't be able to sleep with all the noise especially if your room is near the lifts; and my request was granted thank God. Rooms were ok, actually better than I expected. It was clean and well-kept. The bed was big enough. There was a TV with cable channels. Restroom was small but again, expected (though clean in my opinion). There was a closet for your stuffs with hangers and all. The room also came with coffee sachets, a kettle for hot water (very important for me!), 2 bottled water, and toiletries as well. Fresh towels were provided. The only pet peeve I had about the room itself was there was no blanket (I don't know if that was really the case but if it is it's UNACCEPTABLE) and I had to call the reception THREE times to ask for one coz I was freezing. That's the other thing, receptionist could use a bit more customer service (though he was not rude just acted like I was a bother to him when I was asking for my blanket, duh!). They brought me the blanket 30mins after my last call grrr... And it wasn't a very good blanket as well; not thick enough. Anyway I decided to walk around a bit after check-in since I need to buy an SG sim card for making calls. The nearest mall is City square mall, it's about 10minutes walk from the hotel. That walk was fun since I got to see a bit more of the area and found the nearest MRT (Farrer Park) just opposite the mall. So I can honestly say transportation is ok if you're looking for a decent but accessible inn NOT in Geylang. Though I would imagine getting to the hotel with your luggage from the airport might not be so easy due to the walk; just a warning. My husband got to the hotel fine at around 2am and we checked out that morning fast and easy. By then the (younger) receptionist was more hospitable and a lot nicer. All in all I would definitely recommend this inn for those looking for cheap alternatives to Geylang hotels. I am actually considering it for my next SG trip soon.
UR119250165	The external and communal areas of this hotel look great - but the rooms unfortunately are not. They smell of damp, are on the small side and are in nee of an update. The location is okay - you'd pay more if you were more central and as long as you are willing to use the MTR (underground) to get around it's fine - about a 5 minute walk from Farrer Park station (exit B). There's not a lot to do in Little India though, although there's a shopping centre about 5 minutes walk away that has food outlets. Free wifi in the lobby worked well.
UR118775745	Stayed there only for one night. Friendly staff, clean yet small rooms with TV and aircon. Close to MRT Station Farrer Park and to Little India. A bit noisy due to construction works (Sep 2011), also close to some temples. Better than expected. Not as noisy and dirty as some nearby hostels, a good choice for independent travellers who are not extremely tight on budget.
UR118360734	Wanted a clean moderate price hotel with basic comforts- just the opposite, it was smelly, the air-con leaked and flooded the room, the toilet sink leaked, the power points very hidden under the bedstead. Only one door of the cupboard could be open, the other was right behind the bedstead. There were no door hooks to hang the clothes, bed blanket smelt musty and was very dusty- not an ideal place to stay in singapore- i would definately not go there again. only plus point it was near the shops and mrt stations. the staff were not so friendly and helpful either.
UR117525835	This hotel is a travellers dream, by that I mean you will want to explore every corner of Singapore just to avoid spending time in your room. We left booking a hotel a bit late and the better rated hotels on Agoda and Trip Advisor were fully booked. We are aware that hotels in Singapore are more expensive than the rest of Asia but this hotel is poor and you will not find it to be anywhere near good value for money! The room is small and it smelt bad. The room wasn't cleaned for the 3 nights we stayed there. The bathroom was dingy. The location wasn't too bad as just over 5 minutes to MRT station. That's about as positive as I can be about this place, well actually now I think about it the toilet in reception is really nice, looks like they spent all their cleaning budget on a nice toilet as it just doesn't fit in with the standard of the rest of the hotel. And finally........ The room really stank
UR117118105	Great Location, on Racecource and Serangoon Roads with Taxi, Bus outside and Farrer Park MRT 5 mins walk. Good Value rooms for Singapore, also available by the hour.
UR116602374	The down side is that it is right at the edge of the tourist map that you get at the airport and it was initially hard to get our bearings. The Hotel is at the top of Racecourse road on that map, not at the bottom! Even more confusingly, Racecourse Road is in two sections. It is recommended that you print off a google map of this area before you travel. If you turn left out of the hotel and past the temples you head towards the MRT and shopping Mall, turn right (and right again at Ballestier Road and then continue to walk on Lavender Street) to go to the bus station, (where you can catch the bus to locations in Malaysia), and a superb food hall more or less opposite the bus station (Eminent Plaza) where you can have dim sum and Chinese noodle soup for breakfast and a dazzling array of other Chinese food in the evening. LIttle India is close by, but on the MRT side of the Hotel. There is good shopping to be had and interesting places to eat in Little India. There are multiple exits at the Ferrar Park MRT (stop NE8), it is worth checking the map at the station so that you can orientate properly to get back to the Hotel. If you are up for walking, rather than taking public transport, it is not too much hassle to walk all the way down into the financial district, but bear in mind that Singapore is equatorial and so it gets dark at around 7pm. Day Tickets on the MRT are more cost effective than single tickets and you can get back the S$1 deposit on your rail ticket by feeding it back into the ticket machine. The hotel itself was adequate and clean and our triple room was a bit cramped, but there was no chance of a lie in because of temple building works opposite. The location is not the most up market, but we found it clean especially when compared to KL. Access to the room was at 1pm, but you can leave your luggage there when you arrive if that is earlier. The people on reception were courteous but some had limited English.
UR113603498	Once we got over the inappropriate tight hug from the Indian reception dude, we settled into a reasonable room. Compared to other places in Asia, S$95 for a basic twin room is stupidly expensive but this is Singapore and here your wallet will cry. The pro's: * Good quiet location on Racecourse Road - walking distance to Farrer Road MRT on North-East Line * Walking distance to Little India for great food and a few bars * Hawker food market just round the corner - can eat Asian fusion food for less than S$10 per person * Lavender Street bus station 5 min walk if you're planning to head to Malaysia from Singers * Bathrooms are clean enough and reasonable shower * Clean towels provided and beds are ok - good enough for a few nights The con's: * Staff are friendly but really strange - the Indian man walked past me as I used my laptop in the lobby and said "sexy man, oh yes you have sexy body" - completely inappropriate and rather creepy * Rooms are very basic - those facing road suffer from noise from building site during day, those facing inwards suffer for noise from AC units at night All in all, it's not a bad place to bunker down for a few days but if you're planning a longer stay in Singers, do more research and find a deal. The Mitraa just over the road is cheaper (about S$30 per person per night, min of 2 per room though of course you can pay S$60 and get it to yourself) and has wonderful staff but suffers from selfish, noisy guests who treat it like their own home. thanks james
UR110313057	With Singapore being expensive, I'd rather save my dollars on the hotel and spend them on other things. As we were in Singapore at a busy time, and it was alast minute booking, our options were limited and we ended up at Asphodel Inn. On arrival, I was immediately hesiatant, there seemed to be people hanging around and it became clear, it is one of those 'transit' hotels that rent rooms by 2 hour periods. Anyway, when we did eventually get checked in, the rooms were functional and everything worked. The hotel isn't really close to anything, and it's even quite a walk to the nearest MRT or bus stop. It was around 15 minutes to Mustafa Centre, so that was reasonable as we needed to go there. There was wifi which only worked in the lobby and was totally hit and miss so I gave up trying to bother. There are other places much better for the same rate so I would not stay here again for that reason.
UR108798637	My family and I stayed in Asphodel Inn. We found the rooms clean but a bit small for a family with 2 children. the hostel has wifi internet at the lobby area only. The price is inexpensive, but the location is not so good as it is about a kilometer away from the nearest commercial area, and the nearest MRT station is 3 blocks away. this hostel is okay for those who don't mind walking for several blocks or those taking the taxi always.
UR108170592	Asphodel is just the right place if you want to stay in the heart of the city for cheap! Being a student, I was low on budget and this place served the purpose. However, what was special about this place is the service was impeccable. The receptionist had a smile on his face even @ 3 am and the check in post midnight was not a problem too! This is a good place if you traveling to Singapore on a short trip and want to save a few bucks. The rooms are extremely clean and spacious. Highly reckon this to budget travellers. Next time I am in Singa, this is where I would be for sure.
UR106943203	Budget hotel...but OMG what a location!! Walking distance to train, great Indian Restaurants, Football Stadium and all of the great shopping that Little India has to offer!! Staff were ever friendly and always willing to help. The rooms themselves were a tad on the small size...but hey your in Singapore and you should be out enjoying all this great city has, not sitting in a hotel room...so as somewhere to sleep after a hectic day and to recharge those batteries for tomorrow then it's perfect!!!
UR105953882	please save yourself the heartbreak. DO NOT STAY HERE!!! tiny and filthy. bed was disgusting. had to sleep on a airline blanket we had taken from the plane. a prostitute and a "customer" were booking a room as we arrived. staff were horrible. ruined what was the going to be the best holiday I have ever had. We also stayed in Hotel81 in little india. Much nicer, cleaner (A/C was a bit cold though)
UR99135844	we on purpose booked a fairly cheap hotel in Singapore. The first trouble was finding the hotel. We took the subway from the airport, got off at the right station - which had 4 exits. Make sure you check on google.maps beforehand where you need to go. The taxi drivers also had trouble finding the hotel because the Racecourse Road makes a funny, unexpected turn. This beign siad, the location of the hotel is awesome, it's right in the middle of Little India, lots of restaurants around, and once you know your way around the subway station is in waliing distance. The lobby of the hotel is newly renovated and looks welcoming, the staff is friendy and we were happy to find an elevator. BUT our room was tiny tiny and very basic, no fridge but the worst thing was the black mold in the bathroom. Do note this is a very basic hotel.
UR95747071	After reading reviews I thought I got a good deal and was expecting a hotel with no facilities but i was expecting it to be clean. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by staff who barely spoke a word to us, took us to a twin room with a double bed. We had asked for a non-smoking room but we immediately knew it was not a non-smoking room. It stank of cigarette smoke and there were cigarette burns on the bedspread. The room was tiny and there was only a tiny cupboard and table to put belongings on. The tv was in the top corner of the ceiling and it was tiny. There was no room for luggage and so we spent all our time in the hotel room stepping over things. The bathroom was reasonable though could be a bit cleaner. The main disappointment was the bedroom and the lack of cleanliness in the bedspreads and towels provided. Also I do not believe that a "non-smoking" room exists in the hotel, because despite the cigarette smell they insisted it was a non smoking room. The location was pretty good because it was close to a MRT station, but other than that there is nothing much around the hotel. Wireless internet was a pro. However if I had a choice I would pay a little extra for a nicer hotel that I could actually enjoy. It just wasn't worth the price even though it was cheap.
UR90947954	We had a pleasant stay at this hotel. It's a motel rather than hotel. The room is just nice, not too small, just nice. Although we had a car, but we took MRT instead as it's just abt 4mins walk to Ferrar Park st. We will definitely come back here.
UR88151729	"Welcome to Asphodel Inn Singapore" greeted the receptionist as i apporached the front desk. I noticed that it was dusty and wet, obviously, this was a very ancient place. and at the corner of my eye, i noticed some dried up white goo(not sure what it is but smells familiar) in the table just beside. without even uttering a word, she threw the room card at me and showed me the way. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful. Not those kind of hotels where you are treated as family, but instead like one of their own. As i entered the dark and cosy room, i unpacked my belongings and as i put my things in the cupboard i saw a long black figure shaped like a sausage just lying there. Just before i was able to grab it. The receptionist quickly snatched it away and said 'have a good day' before exiting the room. I looked around and said, 'i could get use to this!'.
UR82480282	so small rooms with cockroaches and just one thing is better the situation BUT IT IS NOT WORTHY AS I PAY $ 70 per night it deserve only $ 25
UR72585456	I was looking for cheap and good hotel in Singapore, this one friend told me. The pictures of this hotel look better than in reality, the room was dark, air-conditioning too cold and the bathroom dirty. Hotel is situated in the district of Little India, for some it's an asset, rather I did not like neighborhood, but it is well comunicated with the center.
UR57309364	The sheets and towels were filthy, the room was not cleaned any of the 4 days we were there. I had to go to the front desk and ask for more toilet paper. I'm pretty sure they were renting out some rooms by the hour. Gross, gross, gross....
UR49390738	I stayed at Asphodel Inn during Sept 2009 for 5 nights (during the F1 racing weekend) with my family (2 Adults and 1 Child) Positives -- Location, Location, Location - Excellent location - Near Farrer Park MRT and closer to Indian eateries, Mustafa Mall -- Calm (Relatively) lane -- No frill, budget hotel (I got the room for SG$ 365 for 5 nights) Negatives -- The rooms were too small. -- More of a lodge than a hotel. If you are fond of Indian Food and would like to travel around Singapore, then you can consider Asphodel Inn. If you can Stretch your budget by SG $30 per night, then stay at Fortuna Hotel (bang opposite Mustafa Mall) in Serangoon Road.
UR24009778	Don't expect anything from this hotel. No service, no extra's.. Just a small room with a 'bed' and a tiny bathroom. We spent a few nights in Singapore for holidays and were outside almost the whole day. But pretty sure you'll find better accomodation in Singapore.
UR22831392	The five storey plain vanilla building exemplifies functionality rather than luxury - after all its a value for money hotel. The reception is compact with a single couch for visitors, but the staff is courteous. Do not expect a bellboy to whisk your luggage to your room, since the Inn is lean on staff. The rooms are around 10 x 8 feet on average with a compact double bed. The linen and towels are neat and clean. A small TV with 4 or 5 channels, many in vernacular is hung on a wall bracket. An electric kettle, bottled water and Tea/Coffee mixes are provided. The bathrooms are really tiny but very clean. The Inn does not have a restaurant. Pro's: Economical Fair hygiene Quiet neighbourhood Few minutes walk from Farrer Park MRTS (Metro) Several eating joints nearby - on Perumal Road Store facility for stowing your luggage even after you have checked out Con's Spartan rooms and furniture Cramped accomodation Far from the city center No in house restaurant
UR18472278	This is my second time staying at the Asphodel and I really don't know why I came back. Before my first stay i had been travelling all over Malaysia and was up all night on a train so I welcomed the AC which worked very well. When i returned I had forgotten how small the rooms were, they don't fit much more than the twin bed and a couple suitcases (if you don't want walking space). The bathroom is basic but the hotwater is fine. Location is a 5 min walk to the Ferrer Park Metro and maybe 10 min to Little India. I paid S$60 the first time and now it is S$90 so the value was really not very good. I would have rather paid more for a place with better amenities and a better location. The staff is about as unfriendly as it gets without being rude. You can do better in Singapore.
UR16424387	The only reason why you should stay at this hotel is its location near ferrer park MRT and if you are an Indian it has indian restaurants within one kilometer. Thats it. I still not say that it is a value for money. It is not fair to term this place as hotel.. as they provide absolutely no service except the rooms which are very tiny and badly orgainzed. Whole hotel and lobby smells bad. Bathrooms has hot water showers but bathroom hardly has space to stand and take shower. No soaps or shampoo just a liquid soap dispneser installed in your bathroom having poor quality of liquid soap. We stayed there for 5 days (three rooms) and every time we came across to reception there is a new male face on reception but all are rude and mannerless. No exceptions. They behave badly and erogantly. TV is useless in the room as it does not have any channles that can keep you or your child busy. Bathroom water heaters are strage and you can only have shower in lukewarm water. Airconditioners are of lowest quality without remote and Elevator (lift) has problems. They claim to provide hair dryers and Iron but you will never get it as they will say that other guest has borrowed it. No tourist information available. Nobody will pick your luggage to your room. You have to do it yourself while checking in and checking out. And the guy who comes to clean the hotel rooms and lobby is the worst of all not readly to listen to you but always ready to shout on you and he keeps smoking in your room and lobby while cleaning despite of the "No Smoking" Stickers everywhere in the lobby. Beds are very small as the rooms. They give two 500 ml Water bottles everyday which ofcourse is not enough and when we ask for water they tell us to drink from toilet tap or wash basin tape. Isnt it ridiculous ? I will never stay at this place again and advice you also stay away from here. If you are looking for cheap accomodation better stay at hostel than this hotel.
UR13417085	i don 't like this inn .it is smelly and dirty. the reception is very rude(man),they are not friendy , not answer for our question and need properly.i feel very bad to stay there .
UR11958549	This was not my first choice of hotel by any means. I spent hours online trying finding a room for less than SD$100 on Christmas Day and couldn't get much of anything in the city and I refuse to stay in Geylang. The popular hostels were all booked solid and most hotels have raised their rates considerably in the past few months. Expedia had a reasonable price and the reviews here weren't horrid, so I went ahead and booked it. Asphodel Inn's location is pretty inconvenient with the exception of the Farrer Park MRT station (5 min. walk). The surrounding area is close to Little India, but that's about it. (15 min. walk to Bugis) Sheets were very clean, bathroom was clean and TV had HBO. Shower was part of the rest of the bathroom as the drain was on the opposite side near the toilet, but I just thought of it as character. There wasn't too much hot water coming from the heating unit in-line to the showerhead. No frills at all, but the lock on the door worked and the staff was friendly which was all I was really looking for. A paint job and some interior decorating wouldn't kill anyone and would help justify the price.. But, Do I wish I would have splurged and gone with a modern and more convenient hotel? Nope.. this place was fine.
UR11066574	This hotel looks ok from the outside and in the communal areas. However our room was (seriously) tiny, dingy and grubby. It was not cleaned during our 3 night stay. However the staff are nice and helpful and the location is reasonable as it is close to Farrer Park MRT. It was the cheapest double en suite we could find but I wished we'd just stretched the budget.
UR6025079	Room ok. nearest from MRT. But not very closed to Mustafa center.
UR128422706	Let me begin by saying that if you have never vacationed on a Caribbean island and are used to tidy suburban towns at home and lots of hand-holding when you travel, Vieques and this hotel might not be the place to start. The island has a few rough edges mixed in with lots of local color. BBH has a convenient location, but few extras, and would best suit an independent traveler who plans to spend most of the time touring the island or going to one of the beaches during the day. It is absolutely essential to have a cell phone to contact the owner/managers when they are not in the office. While they will help with reserving island trips and restaurants etc, they encourage you to make these reservations yourself by cell phone. No phones in the rooms. To be honest, there are few amenities here and some sprucing up is still needed. On the plus side, the owners are a pleasant young couple, the pools are lovely, and the ocean view nonstop. You can walk to the little town, and it is perfectly safe to walk back to the hotel at night after dinner. We liked the other guests we met there and gathered a lot of the information about what to see and do from them. The island has plenty to offer in the way of history and natural phenomena. It would be wise to read up on the history of the island and the role the US Navy played in making the island what it is today (both good and bad) in order to really understand it. A good place to start gathering island information is at the office of The Vieques Conservation and Historical Trust in Esperanza. There is a wealth of information available there. Much better than the government-run tourist information office in Isabel Segunda. There are some very good restaurants and art galleries run by the large population of American artists who own winter homes there. The pace of the island is slow and the island is relatively free from over-development and honky-tonk tourist traps. A couple of final suggestions for planning your stay: Be sure to reserve a rental car before you arrive on the island. Jeeps are the best and fun to drive. Bring a raincoat for the frequent showers and just casual clothing. Be sure not to miss an evening in one of the little bistros in Isabel. You will hear some great music and enjoy good company along with the rum punch.
UR127742915	This was our first stay at Bravo Beach and it was a delightful little B & B. Apparently it is under new management and a very nice young couple is running the place. The views from the upstairs rooms are spectacular! The hotel is very small and on the water in Isabel II. It has 2 pools, was very clean, the rooms were somewhat modern decor. They have an honor bar, which we love and a small breakfast every morning. We enjoyed staying at this little B & B.
UR127606947	We couldn't have been happier staying at Bravo Beach. We stayed a total of 8 nights in Vieques, all of them at BBH. The spot is about a 3 minute walk from the ferry on the Northern side of the island called Isabel Segundo. SO glad we chose to stay here rather than somewhere on the trendy touristy South side in Esperanza. BBH offered us lovely breakfast everyday, really nice big beach chairs and beach towels and even a cooler bag. When we arrived Carl (the owner) was nice enough to go out of his way and find us a vehicle because we spaced it... I feel like there were a number of times I said "Wow! Thank You soo much'! The two pools were also amazing. The back courtyard pool backed up right to their Honor Bar, which we thought was such a clever idea. I remember thinking that there wasn't one complaint I had. I'm serious! The rooms were simply decorated and super clean, the staff were all helpful and polite... Love Love Loved it. And I'll definitely be back.
UR127429692	My wife and I had a great visit at the BBH. It's run by a really lovely young couple, and they've done a great job restoring what was apparently quite an old facility. Things look great now - rooms are nice (highly recommend the 2nd floor ocean view rooms) with a nice bed and are generally very clean; two (albeit small) pools, one of which is ocean side, and a really nice courtyard with an inexpensive honor bar. They're both very helpful when you need anything. The only minor downside was the shower water could be a bit inconsistent - on two occasions, it wasn't possible to get anything other than lukewarm water which was a bummer after scuba diving. This could have been a one off problem. All in all, highly recommended, reasonably priced hotel in a great location, staffed by a great couple who obviously care a lot about the property.
UR126708103	My fiancÃ© and I are spontaneous. As such, we planned our vacation to Puerto Rico the day before we left. Once there we decided to plane hop over to the romantic Island of Vieques. We found out that hotels are booked weeks to months ahead during the busy season which we did not. To our surprise we found one room open at the Brave Beach Hotel. I have to tell you that we felt so blessed to have found this place by chance. It was clean and the owner was friendly. After trekking the island we noticed that the Bravo Beach Hotel was not only clean but also well maintained as compared to the other Hotels. The swimming pool in the back butts up against the beach where the sunset is simply incredible and romantic especially when in the pool with your partner. The roofs of the hotel have chairs to relax in and hey there is another pool in the court yard. I am telling you that you will not be disappointed if you decided to stay at the Brave Beach Hotel. And it is hard to find an owner who truly takes pride in his hotel like this one does. Enjoy!
UR126505327	Bravo Beach Hotel was purchased by the new owners about 8 months ago. You will see in some of the reviews from the winter that they were under renovations but those are now completed. The hotel is very close to the ferry so you won't have to travel far. It is right on the ocean located outside of town, in a very quite location. The hotel is modern, sophisticated, while still maintaining the "laid-back" feel of the island. They owners are very welcoming and accomodating; what you would expect from a polite mid-western couple. We booked their courtyard room (the cheapest option) and when we showed up Karl(owner)informed us that they had a cancellation and they were upgrading us to the ocean-front suite for two nights (because as Karl said, "it's your honeymoon afterall.") The room was breath-taking, with a private patio overooking the ocean. We moved to the room we booked originally on the third night and this was nice as well, smaller but just as comfortable and has all the same amenities. Each room is equiped with a flat-screen tv/dvd player, air conditioning, hair dryers, Aveda toiletries, 2 beach chairs, 2 beach towels (in additiona to normal bath towels), and a cooler. All the beach items you can take off-site when you do beach exploring. The two pools are inviting. There is a patio area in the courtyard/garden that has a new large gas grill for the use of guests. There is also a very reasonably priced, fully equiped honor-bar, where you can make your own non-alcoholic/alcoholic drinks and simply write down your selections which will be added to your bill at the end of your stay. We do advise all staying here to rent a car of at least part of your trip. The island is spread-out and the beaches in the wildlife refuge are not to be missed. Please note - there is no hotel accessible to thse beaches so the Bravo Beach i just as good as an option as others.
UR126284708	We were looking for a quiet, relaxing place for a girls' trip, and Bravo Beach Hotel was exactly what we needed. Our room was very clean, airy, open and pleasantly unassuming. I loved walking in to the smell of clean sheets and light spilling in from the windows. The view of the ocean was breathtaking, and the porch chairs were the perfect place to sip wine and listen to the waves. The host and hostess (Carl and Janna) were incredibly helpful and warm, and also very organized (not something you always find in Puerto Rico). With all the dinner and beach recommendations, it was like having a free travel guide! And we loved having beach chairs, a cooler and beach towels provided. The property is in a great location, within walking distance to several restaurants and bars. And with two pools and lots of lounging locations, the hotel makes a day away from one of the islands' gorgeous beaches just as special. I loved the boutique yet relaxed feel of it all - a great combination of beauty and comfort, but without the snobbery of expensive resorts. For anyone looking for a great island vacation, I'd encourage you to check out the Bravo Beach Hotel!
UR126247979	Bravo Beach Hotel offers quiet, unassuming bliss. My husband and I spent our anniversary at BBH for 7 days. We opted for an oceanview room, and I think we got the best one (#7). Our private balcony overlooked the ocean side pool and Atlantic surf - and off in the distance, Culebra. This property's incredible location is certainly part of its appeal. I would recommend an oceanview room, not only for the incredible view, but because an industrious rooster lives next to the court side rooms. Fortunately, the sound of the ocean (almost) drowns him out in the morning. The rooms themselves are simply appointed, but include a mini-fridge, beach chairs and cooler. There is still a little work to do to update them completely, but they met my expectations and I have no complaints. The property's grounds are wonderful and becoming even better by the day. The owners were painting and landscaping while we were there. There is a terrace above the oceanside pool for sunbathing. The garden pool is protected from the wind by a beautiful garden, but the sun still shines in most of the day. It is also next to the well-stocked honor bar. The continental breakfast has cereal, fresh fruit, toast, coffee and juice. When I booked the hotel, they were not offering a continental breakfast yet, so I was happy to find it on arrival. After spending $20 on a bad breakfast in Isabel II, it made me appreciate it that much more. The property is an easy walk into Isabel II, which has great places to eat (Conuco and El Patio) and grab a drink (Alâ€™s Mar Azul). When I asked various locals whether it was safe to walk around, I was assured that it was safe (usually with a chuckle). The ferry dock is about a 5 minute walk away from BBH, up and down a hill. Carl and Janna are great hosts and genuinely want to make sure that you have a great stay at their property. I gave this hotel 5 stars because it completely met â€“ and in very many ways exceeded â€“ my expectations, especially for the value. I would recommend BBH without hesitation to friends and family. This is not a 5 star resort or even a 5 star boutique hotel (not yet anyway)â€“ but staying at BBH was definitely a 5 star experience.
UR125795773	We had planned on staying at another place near Esperanza (Inn at Blue Horizon) when they had lost our reservation- so they did not have a place for us leaving us a day to find a place last minute- luckily we called Carl and he had a great spot for us- considering it was the last two days of our vacation, we were splurging on a place and we got room "9"- I guess it is a honeymoon suit, and it is spectacular, great view and sounds to fall asleep and wake up to. This neighborhood is way more relaxed and quiet than Esperanza. This side of the island is better to relax, no loud cars driving by at 12am- the food in Isabel Segunda IS WAY BETTER AS WELL they had a bunch of beach stuff handy to take out which was great- and I almost regret not using either of the TWO swimming pools- they have two! wish I would have planned it out with BBH in the first place thanks Carl and Janna- your place is a jewel
UR125587238	First off, I'd like to thank Janna and Carl for the generous treatment during our stay. My husband had trouble with Wifi at HT, so Janna and Carl accommodated us for the 2 days prior to our stay there. BBH has great view, we were in a suite on upper level with the sea softly serenading us at nite. Two great pools, bordering both the ferry and a residential community. We had a nice contental breakfast every day, they are working on providing a hot breakfast. Remember getting parts for stoves is a chore in Vieques. Vieques is an island off an island, so double trouble there. Walking distance to some great places. They have only recently taken over the property and are doing a great job. I wish them luck in adding another property to the wonderful island of Vieques. Thank you for a lovely stay and good luck in completing your renos. We will be back next year.
UR125586913	Pros: nice pools Cons: very small room (courtyard rooms), noisiest aircon ever. As a more general comment ... Hotel suffers from a slight identity crisis - boutique hotel or vacation home? Jury is still out. The place is comfortable enough but comes across a lot more stylish than it actually is.
UR125414587	The Bravo Beach Hotel is amazing! My boyfriend and I stayed in one of their Ocean View rooms. It is definitely worth the extra money! The view is spectacular from the balcony, which is furnished with a high table and chairs. On a clear day you can see the neighboring islands! The hotel provides a continental breakfast in the morning which is great to be able to have a quick meal before heading out to the beaches for the day. It was a really appreciated service! The owners, Janna and Carl, are great hosts! Theyâ€™re around to answer questions about the best beaches and restaurants on the island. It is obvious they take pride in the hotel and want to make sure everyone has a great stay. Quick note, since other reviewers have commented on it, although the hotel does include â€œbeachâ€� in the title, there is no swimming beach as it is full of coral and rocks. The owners were very up front about this with us before our stay.
UR125357100	We really enjoyed our 4-night stay in the Villa at Bravo Beach Hotel. I think we were the first wedding on property under the new ownership -- it was a very simple wedding on the 2nd floor terrace and everything was perfect. Janna and Carl were very accommodating. The villa was very nice and so much bigger than we expected. The swimming pools were great for our two children and we loved the easy access to town and restaurants. Vieques is a great island to visit and explore. We hope to stay at the Bravo Beach Hotel again sometime! Good luck to Janna and Carl!
UR125237901	Clean and comfortable guesthouse in Vieques- beautiful view of ocean during breakfast. Friendly and accessible owners/managers on site to help answer your questions and provide info about the island. Convenient location in Isabel with ample parking. Reliable and complimentary wi-fi. We really enjoyed our stay here (3 nights) and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Vieques! Simple continental breakfast offered each morning to get your day started. Only feedback for improvement is that the blinds are sheer, see-through curtains and let all the early morning sunlight in. Would recommend the hotel upgrade to more heavier-duty blinds to provide for a more comfortable sleep experience. Also, I read they stock the bathrooms with Aveda products so I didn't bring my own shampoo/conditioner. However, the hair products provided in the shower are not of a high quality although the Aveda bar soaps were just fine. Not so sure about the shampoo/conditioner being Aveda. I recommend bringing your own hair products.
UR125187168	My husband and I ended up at BBH because we ran out of time at another rental. What a great accidental find! Carl offered us an upgrade which was just amazing. We felt like the Atlantic was lapping at the foot of our bed. Carl and Janna are doing it "right" the first time and we will definitely return to enjoy the fruits of their labor! B&S Yarmouth, ME
UR125025245	My husband and I had a wonderful time at Bravo Beach Hotel. A young couple owns it and they were awesome! Our ocean view room was clean, spacious, had wifi,cellphones worked, but most of all....relaxing. The resturants were within walkin distance and excellant. The beaches on Vieques are so beautiful!
UR124498700	This is the best place to stay! Carl and Janna are fantastic! The views are wonderful. There are two beautiful pools and several magical courtyards. The fresh breakfast they provide every morning is the perfect way to start your day on the island. Just like the beaches at Vieques, you can always find a romantic spot to hear the waves and watch the stars...the perfect way to end your day on this beautiful island. The provided beach chairs and cooler were so convenient. The a/c provided respite from the rooster conversations of the early mornings! can't say enough good things!
UR124391972	We stayed at this hotel on the recommendation of friends who had stayed there a few years ago under the previous owner. Although it was not quite what we had expected, we had a fabulous stay and would most definately return. The views from our room were beautiful and the inner courtyard courtyard is a beautiful oasis in the afternoon. The owners could not have been more pleasant or accomodating. We enjoyed the location in Isabel II which allows for an easy walk to many bars and restaurants as well as a few shops and a lovely art gallery. A car is still a "must" to experience the spectacular beaches on the other side of the island and to enjoy the restaurants in the more touristy Esperanza.
UR123885325	Hosts Carl and Janna did a great job in the 7 months (as of this writing) since they bought this hotel in a state of disarray. Today the place is very inviting and in pretty good shape (a few rough edges will certainly be smoothed by the time you visit). It is no longer a "construction zone" as others reported in the past. They now started serving a perfectly adequate and healthy continental breakfast. The hotel is in walking distance from the ferry, even if you're pulling rolling luggage. We found it quiet (in the sense that we heard no human-made noises at night); we slept with our bathroom window open (no need for AC), listening to the sounds of the rainforest, the water waves, and then the roosters in the morning. Our room was on the courtyard; I think upstairs rooms facing the water should be quieter yet. The hotel met all our expectation; but, just to make sure it meets your as well, please note that, yes the hotel is right on the water, but no, there is no beach per se. When you sit down at breakfast, you'll see the water just past the pool. But if you actually go past the pool, you'll see a messy clump of coral rock and concrete foundations. Past that, the sea bottom is too shallow and rocky, full of sharp edges and urchins, so you won't be able to swim in it. And access to the sea is limited: at 6:00 PM the door is locked for security reasons. As long as you don't expect to lay on a beach and go swimming in the sea, the BBH is a great choice in Isabel Segunda.
UR123555932	BBH was a pleasant surprise. One of the great views of any room we have stayed in and for the Money a great value. Its a work in progress but the owners are going to turn this into a jewel. I would recommend this hotel to the traveler who does'nt want a RESORT type feel. Carl and Janna could not be more welcoming and will go the extra mile to make sure you have a great time. Tip to the wise, Buy Gas whenever you can. - Jamie R
UR120344297	If you're looking for a place to stay in Vieques, the Bravo Beach Hotel is the place. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are very comfortable and clean and well appointed. The view is incredible. And the owners make you feel right at home. We plan on going back to Vieques and this is where we are going to stay.
UR118090147	I have recommended this hotel to every one of my friends to go adventure to. My husband and I stayed here in August and we stayed in the Ocean View Room and it was spectacular! I really felt like we were on our own paradise island getaway. The owners were very friendly and anything we needed, they were able to assist us in getting. The hotel was going through some renovations with interior work needing to be done, but our room was complete. They gave us an excellent deal to stay there during this time and it was well worth it. The infinity pool was not working when we were there, but there is another pool that was just as relaxing to be at whenever we wanted. Some days it was nice to just relax in the pool and other days we went to the beaches. It is worth to rent a car while there to go to the beaches because they are so amazing! Never have I been to a place where you could go to 5 different beaches in one day. It was nice to come back to the hotel after a long day of being at the beach, enjoy a cocktail, and watch the sunset from our balcony. We were able to take a look at all the rooms and it doesn't matter which one you stay in because they all have about everything you need with an amazing view of the Ocean right there. It was everything I imagined of being on an week long island adventure! AMAZING!!! I cannot wait to go back again!!!
UR114666781	I Stayed at Amaryl City Hotel in Berlin with my boyfriend last year. he had booked the trip as a present and was shocked and disappointed when we arrived to see have the hotel boarded up - they were doing renovations (which im sure have finished by now) we went in and the reception area is long and narrow, had a very old musky feel to it. check in took about 15 minutes, then we went upstairs in the oldest lift i have ever seen. complete with the cage type door you pull across. any way it got us there, when we entered the room we were surprised, it was HUGE! extremely high ceilings, double bed, verfy comfy, white walls and really clean, bathroom a bit dated but it was clean and worked! tv and a view out to the courtyard. I did not see any other guests while we were there which was a bit weird, but a good enough location, and a great price for what we wanted.
UR108034434	I stayed at the Amaryl City Hotel in Berlin for some days with my partner. We urgently needed a room to stay in for four days and this hotel seemed to be a reasonable choice. Rooms are OK (our was) but you hear everyone walking through the hall. It is not expensive but we has some weird experience with a young receptionist - he wanted to reserve a room for us at the price a little bit higher (some 20%) than it was written on the web. After that we made a reservation on the web ourselves and the price was even lower (some 5%) than written on their website (!) We than turned back and packed in. For this reason we've preferred to talk to other receptionist later on. There were two others who were doing their job as professionals. Quite strange and bizarre experience for the European capital. The hotel was than quite decent for some days stay. But: be aware at suspicious receptionist.
UR80988345	125 Euros for a single room? Sorry, did you mean a single broom cupboard? The rooms are so small you couldn't swing a cat in it, although your average alley cat would be far too discerning to ever grace this place with their presence. At least the room had a tv, although request a remote control at your own peril as the porter seems to interpret this request as a euphemism for indecent proposals. And contrary to what the website advertises, the WiFi is not free. Also be aware to have enough cash on you because this 'quirky' hotel requires advance payment in cash before you can actually see the room... recommendation: check out!
UR66079368	We stayed here for a few nights in June 2007. We needed a base in berlin for a few days as we were heading to dresden for a conference. This hotel is more like a glorified hostel. Room was big but bathroom was gross, room very plain and not like the pictures on hotels.com again another misleading representation. The breakfast was ok filled the spot but my boyfriend hated it so he went without. It was a very old fashioned hotel reminded me of something from a WWII movie. The lift nearly killed us the first day so we used the stairs even with our heavy suitcases as we were worried we'd be decapitated!! The location was great really central. If i was a student looking for somewhere to put down the head for the night fine. But this hotel is not for a romantic break with your significant other!! The staff were fine i have to say.
UR49491632	To start with it, I have never written a review online however after my stay at the Amaryl I felt compelled to warn any potential visitors. I feel is difficult to classify this place as a Hotel its closer to being a Hostel but even that is being generous. On arrival you are greeted by what can only be described as a building site. The service as you arrive at reception is truely appauling. The breakfast is barely edible accompanied with warm orange juice. If you are unfortunate enough to stay here I highly recommend you do not use the Lifts! I would not recommend this 'Hotel' to anyone
UR49054936	Pro's - Good location. Con's - Ant infested bedrooms, bathrooms and beds. Hostel not a hotel. Owner wouldn't understand 'Customer Care' in a million years. Fire doors wedged open with fire extinguishers. Warm orange juice. Would I recommend? - Are You having a Laugh!
UR48971290	The Hotel is situated in quite a good location, however this is the only good point. The external approach of the hotel is an indication of what to expect, a dilapidated state, showing a lack of care and maintenance. This general theme is continued through the service recieved by staff. Our room was on the fifth floor, and we arrived at night. While the idea of having corridor lighting on a timed switch may be environmentally friendly, it would be much more useful if the lights stayed on long enough for us to get to our ant-infested room. The room was advertised as a three bed room, but was in fact two singles and a sofa, and the bedding was not changed at all during our stay. The bathroom had notices that you were to leave you towels on the floor if you required new ones. However every night we cam back over the whole week we stayed there, they were still on the floor when we returned in the evening. The hair dryer in the bathroom was appaling, as effective as an asthmatic dog breathing on you and emitted a smell of burning electrics. The television had no remote control- not the biggest problem however. The breakfast was possibly the worst point of the stay, it was literally a selection of processed meats a plastic cheese with stale bread rolls. Or the option of mueseli with some room temperature milk, that i doubt had been chilled at all. The hotel management on the second night of the stay demaned a security deposit from our group due to damages allegedly caused by us during our stay, despite the fact the damages were clearly old and had been there probably since the hotel was last decorated (likely pre-dating the fall of the wall). The alternative to paying the deposit was that they would kick us out. They said that the deposit would be against any further damages, however the following morning they decided to keep the deposit, and again threatened us with turfing us out. We were a large group of about 50 people, on a study visit, however there seemed to be some confusion between us and another large group of students also staying the hotel, and as such we were all treated as one mass group. On the final day we asked that we could leave our bags in the hotel as we were not due to leave berlin till late afternoon. The management wanted 3 euros per person, which isnt unreasonable as local secure storage cost roughly the same. However, the secure storage room the hotel promised turned out to be an adjacant disused store front, with the entire groups bags on full display to passers by. If anybody has seen guesthouse paradiso or fawlty towers and laughed at the notion of a hotel that bad, think again that places like that actually exist. Avoid this Hotel at all costs. Sleep in your car if you have to.
UR48856682	Only good thing was the location, Was promised rooms which were not provided correctly. Was also told free internet access but this is only available from an awkward terminal in the lobby. It got to the point with this hotel i was refused to use any services (which are limited) so as they would not make any more money out of myself.
UR48736220	POSITIVES: The hotel is in a good location close to Kurfustendamm high street with only a short walk to the nearest U-Bahn Station enabling any traveller easy access to explore the rest of the city. NEGATIVES: This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in (more hostel like than hotel like), the rooms were cramped and uncomfortable with small ant infested beds and bathrooms. The free Geoffnet access is only available in reception, if you want access in you room be prepared to pay upfront. In fact be prepared to pay upfront for absolutely everything, if the management can rip you off they will!!!!
UR48702797	I would like to think that I write reviews in a balanced manner in order that others can benefit from my experiences, so despite all of the bad things about the Amaryl, I will start with positives. The Good? The hotel is in a great location, close to good shopping areas, transport links, and restaurants. (Sorry but that your lot!). The Bad! The wildlife in the rooms was a bit unexpected, most of the rooms had an infestation of ants. The service from the management was nothing short of appalling, one of my colleagues was given a room that had previously suffered some minor damage, the management wanted 300 Euro for this and would not accept that the damage existed prior to our arrival, the money was demanded with menaces i.e. pay up or get out. The condition the rooms varies from reasonable to disgraceful, allocation is all down to luck of the draw. Fire doors throughout the building where wedged open, despite our concern and action to remove wedges staff continued to disregard the risk of fire spread. On checking out we asked to leave our cases until our transport arrived, again the management where quick to exploit the situation in seeking 100 euros for the use of an adjacent disused shop front. To say this place was like Faulty Towers would be doing that fine establishment a disservice, suffice to say I could go on, but would rather conclude with a warning the you stay hear at your peril.
UR46784225	I travelled with a small family group, my single roomm was a proper single - no supplement. Accommodation basic, cleanliness excellent, lashings of hot water, comfortable bed, very good breakfast bar, friendly staff. The only downside was the lack of a mirror for dressing, and the small bathroom mirror was sited too high to be of any use to a person only five foot two inches in height.
UR30749695	While the house may look old and a bit shabby, the rooms are clean and breakfast is ok. The staff is very friendly, and the distance to Ku'damm and the next underground station (Uhlandstrasse) is short. Be prepared to pay in cash on your arrival - the staff can explain you how much in fees credit card companies charge, and you do not want to enrich those guys, will you?
UR21067165	Don't go -- this hotel is only intent on ripping you off where they can. They make you pay *cash* upfront, which I have never seen before. There is no negotiation and complete indifference to complaints. The rooms may be clean, but they are shabby, and breakfast is bad. We only went because Berlin was booked out and wish we hadn't.
UR19067452	I just wanted to give people a word of warning if wanting to visit Berlin and are looking for a good value hotel. My family and I ( 5 people in total) booked this hotel online in June using a credit card. I called the hotel after my father booked it online and they said that the booking and payment had been received. The 155 Euros was taken out of my parents account. I called a few days before our stay about parking. The person saying you could park on the street outside the hotel. - As we arrived we were shocked. The hotel was situated between 2 shut down shops with boarded up windows. Not a nice first impression. We went inside and I gave our name, which they had no record of, even though I called up straight after the booking and they said it was there. So, they said that they have a free room anyway. Fine. Then, the lady wrote us a bill for 155 Euros which we had to pay. But, we had already paid. The money was out of my parents credit card account. So, luckily my parents have online banking and were able to show them that we had already paid. Which they still didn't believe. The woman then called the manager over who wasn't the most helpful chap in the world. He said that we have to pay 155 euros. He had no record of our money being paid. He said that they take credit cards online to make sure that the people booking the hotel are real. They then take the money from the account and pay the money back in within 10 days. The money (after nearly 3 months) was not back in my parents account. He said that he had no access to our accounts, and that it was done through another banking system. We would have to pay on arrival. So, he said he was going to look through his bank details and credit card company to ask where the money was. He said that if the next day, there was still no sign of the money in his account we should pay the 155 Euros and then at some point the other 155 euros would be back in my parents account. - So we went up to the room. 5 beds is what we needed. 5 beds is what we got. 5 single beds in one room - a family room. Lovely. Definately not what was booked. Also on the back of the door, there was a notice about prices per night. starting at 200Euros PP/PN? That made no sense at all. Plus, the parking outside the hotel was not outside the hotel as that was illegal. We had to park the car on the next street which cost 7Euros. Then my dad had to pay another 50Euros (which you get back when you give the ticket for the car window back) So, we went back downstairs and said that we were leaving. Not happy with the service or room. The guy then said we have to pay 80% of the fee if we were not staying there. No way. So I said, 'what if I go out of the door now and don't pay you that 80%, seeing as you can't access our bank details?' he said that he had to trust us to pay it. - uh huh - BYE BYE! --- So, a word of advice. If you are looking for somewhere cheap to stay in Berlin, don't stay there. We luckily found a wonderful hotel called "Leonardo" by Schoenefeld Airport.
UR14932373	We had a four night stay at the Amaryl City in March. Initial view of the hotel was a bit daunting as two of the large windows on the ground floor were boarded up. However, the owner was saying that workmen had let him down and he had plans to rectify this. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 children and were delighted with our family room. It wasn't overly big but more than adequate and very clean. The bathroom was also well finished and very clean. Towels were changed every day and maid service was excellent. Breakfast was a big hit with the kids,staff were very obliging and although fairly basic there was plenty to eat. The location of this hotel is great, transport links and proximity to the city centre is fantastic. There are also many restaurants close to the hotel and we found a great family Italian restaurant which the kids loved. The owner of the hotel was especially welcoming - always very helpful when you had a question about the area and even taught the children some German. We had a fantastic time in Berlin and wouldn't hestitate to recommend this hotel to our friends.
UR14479016	This was the first time we stayed at the Amaryl City-Hotel. This is a simple hotel, excellent for those visitors who are just seeking adequate accommodation and a very good breakfast. The rooms are quite comfortable, silent and very clean, the service is good and the staff make you feel at home and they are very hospitable and helpful. In fact my son who stayed with us at the hotel intends to stay in it again on his future visit to Berlin. I would like to thank all the wonderful people at the hotel for making things easy for us during our stay in Berlin. There is internet in the entire hotel and its free !
UR8750908	This place is a dump! FACT! my friend booked it online before we went over and never read a review about it. we were laughing when walking outside it seeing this boarded up hotel, until we realised it was where we were staying. we had a twin room, more like a shoe box. not even a remote for the tv in the place. the only decent person working there was the night proter. do not stay here! it is a complete rip off, no wonder they demand cash up front and have huge cancllation fees. we were completly disgusted with the kip. berlin is a nice city though.
UR8749806	dont stay here, never before have i stayed in a "box" twin bedroom 3 star hotel and pay 4 star costs, shambles. how did it get its 3 stars anyway??? our bathroom which was small was bigger than our rooms. rip - off hope the close down. ps dont bother getting up for the breakfast
UR8749168	This has to be without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Described as a three star hotel with great facilities, I can only say that my expectations were not matched at all by what I was greeted withon arrival. First of all the front of the "hotel" (it's really no better than a very poor hostel) consisted of crumbling plaster and a bar-front sandwiched between two boarded-up ground floor fronts. The staff at reception were unfriendly and treated our group with suspicion as if we would not pay the money. Also it was not possible to pay be credit card, since their credit card machine was "broken". I even left a Berlin guide book at recepttion by accident which was very kindly swiped by the staff and kept behind reception for me! Having dropped our bags in our respective rooms, my group decided that they did not want to stay in this hotel. A quick review of the cancellation policy revealed that 80% of the entire cost of the stay would be charged should we cancel, so we decided our only option was to stay put and get on with it. The rooms are tiny and very basic. TV has no remote (not a big deal I know but not what you would expect from a 3 star hotel). The bathrrom had just about enough room for a tiny shower and toilet bowl and sink. The beds are small and very close together with no room to move them apart. There was little ot no room service or cleaning on our room, and no "do not disturb" signs to put on the door. All in all I think that this hotel is an absolute RIP-OFF and A COMPLETE SCAM. The owners obviously have no morals in charging what they do for the service they provide. Any time I was at reception there were other guests complaining about the place, and from what I can see from these reviews, there have been many other dissatisfied people that have had the misfortune to stay in this dump. Do not even consider staying in this place.
UR7724388	I booked the hotel through bookings.com. This was by far the worst experience ever. They are a complete fraud with very rude owners. I would even call them racists given how they pointed fingers to me and called me "an Asian". After realizing that all the advertisement regarding the hotel's features were a fraud, when I wanted to cancel, they demanded 80% of the full 8 days ( I booked for 8 days online.) stay amount. When I tried to explain how this was not reasonable, the started yelling at me. This was a very shocking experience. Yell at customers pointing fingers with racist comments??? They also refused to let us come pick up our luggage that was suppose to be delivered from the airport (lost luggage) after we decided to not stay at the hotel. Furthermore, the train ticket we arranged to be delivered to the hotel, they refused to give it to us. It was worth 100 Euros. We had to repurchase the tickets. The most unbelievable part is that after we left the hotel without staying, they charged my credit card company multiple times the 100% 8 day stay amount. I have submitted a fraud claim to the credit card company. NEVER!!! stay at this hotel.
UR6080952	My first impression of the hotel when approaching it was not good at all, it's next to some strange bar and already from the outside it looked turkish style and not promising at all. We found out that it is owned by a turkish man, but we found the staff at the hotel pretty nice - we were served drinks at any time of the night in the bar and felt very cosy. The location is very good, 3 minutes to the subway station, and 3-5 minutes walk to the most prominent shopping area in Berlin. The surroundings are highly attractive, with a bunch of perfect restaurants - we enjoyed 2 spanish restaurants, both 2 minutes walk from the hotel. We stayed with my friends, 4 people in a room and though the room is poorly furnished and the bathroom is a bit crippled - you definitely can take it, if you are not very pretentious. I would say that the hotel is rather 2 star. In spite of the decent location of the hotel, I would still advise you to make an effort and search for something more enjoyable in the same district, though, the price you will pay will be fair - at least for our room - for 4 people - it was very low.
UR5912425	The Amaryl City Hotel - Lietzenburger strasse Never ever stay here this has to be the worst hotel in Germany. The Hotel's motto is "give us your money and we promise no service." Upon paying my bill on arrival - I was asked for cash and had to pay an additional 80 euros to pay by card, the level of service was reduced to zero. The manager enjoyed arguing with customers, (never changed his clothes for the duration of my visit - 4 nights!!), there was never any staff at the bar, the room was dirty, and the price was extortionate. 3 star more like no star!!! I would rather slit my own wrists than stay here again, and if this is the last available hotel in berlin, sleep on the streets. Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else!!
UR126233857	Similar to all IBIS hotels this one also offers basic but good quality accomodation for nice price. All in all, I was not prepared for the fact it is so far away from the downtown.Still, the restaurant was very nice, the breakfast as well. I had good stay there but would recomend it rather for highway stoppers rather than for general tourists who intend to explore Barca.
UR121677147	As always when you go to a Ibis hotel you get great price, clean, simple service but good.
UR120166033	4of 5 of the personnel do not speak english. The personnel is inconsiderate/unhelpful/rude/arrogant when you cannot speak spanish - Restaurant was closed without notice, and the frozen pizza warmed in the microwave was absolutely disgusting - Personnel do not take time to explain properly during checking in and out. I shortened my stay by half and checked in another hotel.
UR120031149	The hotel is well connected to the highway going to Barcelona, which is reached in 10-15 minutes. Indoor parking is available (extra charge though...). Rooms are up to Ibis standard, missing nothing, staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast is fine.
UR118446239	We stayed at the Ibis Hotel in September 2011 because of the affordable price compared to staying in the centre of Barcelona. We found the rooms clean and comfortable. However, we would not recommend staying here for leisure or sightseeing purposes. If your a tourist try to find a backpackers or hostel as the Ibis is an unsatisfactory solution. It is a considerable walk (especially with luggage and in the heat) to and from Ibis to the train station. There are a few bakeries along the way for a quick breakfast - however no where to eat dinner. It is then a 20minute train ride (tickets cost about 3.00 euro return per person) to Catalyuna station (the centre of Barcelona.) At night (for two young female travellers) we found the walk uncomfortable and we did not feel very safe. With squatters, people drinking on the streets and occasional prostitutes we opted to go back to Ibis before it got dark. This limited our time as tourists in Barcelona. The staff were friendly and spoke some English however were not able to help at all regarding tourist sites, using the public transport etc. The man at reception didn't know who Gaudi was and could not assist in finding the buildings. Very disappointing. All in all, pay the extra and stay somewhere else in town. Ibis is no solution.
UR116100242	I agree with the other positive reviews. This is your typical IBIS and you can be normally be sure of what you're going to get in advance with an IBIS. I had a good check-in and wifi was 5 euros for 24 hours. However . . . one caveat if you're driving. This hotel provides insufficient parking. The property is "shoe horned" into a very small plot of land, with a minimal number of parking spots surrounded by an 18 ft wire fence with a locked gate allowing for car access. Other than that, it was a good choice for greater Barcelona.
UR35998740	we were looking for a cheap and good accomodation in Barca near the motorway and with a near train stop. This Ibis was perfect. Large rooms, nice, the air con was working perfectly (and really needed), free parking and internet. The rate was very good, 39 euro/night with summer special rate on ibis.com Really reccomend.
UR32659654	We stayed here for 5 nights and got a very good price of only 49 Euros per night, as we had booked nearly, 3 months in advance.The hotel is in the suburbs of Barcelona. One can take the taxi from the airport. It takes about 20 minutes. The nearest local train station is about 900 metres away from where one can take the train to Cornella station. From Cornella, Metro is available to connect to all parts of Barcelona. It is better to know the train time tables to Cornella. The train is normally there every half hour if you miss one then you are stuck for nearly an hour, The air conditioning was not functioning and since we were on a higher floor we couldnot open the window fully and it was quite warm in May. The hotel is next to a motorway so there was a lot of noise. The hotel was otherwise good. Breakfast was nice. For Dinner, we normally ate at Barcelona, however there are a few restaurants around. If you donot mind the travelling time then the hotel was "okay".
UR20224863	HOTEL The room is typical of ibis,with a large shower,however the floor was laminated wood and had a wooden chair near the dressing table which gave the room a cold look and feel,especially when the cleaner left the air con on.we have stayed in a ibis before but this room was not as comfy. However the reception staff were freindly and helpfull giving us a map to the train station(10 minute walk)and a map of Barcelona and other info. AREA Molins de Rei is a mix of comercial and apartment blocks.We arrived around 11pm and took a short walk to find somewhere to eat,there is a chinese restaraunt up the road and the food was not good,the area near the hotel looks bleak at night and not much better during the day,however there are more shops and restaraunts towards the train station. BARCELONA The train from Molins costs 2.80 euros return(25 minutes)and the last train from barcelona is 2355 from sants station. Atractions are expensive(at least 10 euros) Parc Guell and Mont Tibidabo are worth a visit,as is the short train journey to Montserrat and Sitges which has a great beach. Recomended restaraunt is EGIPTE(Las Ramblas 79) Barcelona is very laid back city and a bit ecentric,look out for the guy who walks around the habour area stark naked!! Beware of pick pockets,i had a rucksack on my back and i was waiting at traffic lights,i felt a tug on one of the zips,i turned around quickly and a women had her hand in mid air near my rucksack and quikly pulled her hand back.You will notice that alot of people carry front facing rucksacks.You also dont want to walk along the side streets off Las Ramblas at night,very dodgy looking people lurking along these streets!!! The ibis is not a bad hotel as a base to explore Barcelona,however be aware when booking direct with the Ibis website as my partner booked some months in advance and when we got to the hotel we found out the transaction had not gone through and she had to pay for the room that night.Reception said that they dont take payment untill you arrive,however my partner said there was a pay now option on the website??
UR7714731	my boyfriend and i have just returned from this hotel we went to barcelona for a relaxing break. We took in the sights of the city by day which were amazing, but to our dismay we returned to an unfriendly environment. With all the sights all day long we hoped to return to a relaxed atmosphere but to our dissapointment it was not of such.
UR127883178	I have mixed feelings for this hotel. I guess part of the problem is that the W brand caters to a certain clientele who is looking to have the lobby area turn into an ultra-swanky night club at night. It is to the point where if you are checking in at night, it's so dark in the lobby area that the guest services person writes the wrong room number on your key holder, it's so loud that you have to yell into the guest service person's ear just to be heard, etc. etc. Another things that struck me as weird is that when I checked in, I was asked to sign a document saying that I would list any "roommates" I may have in my room, that I would not be allowed to have more than four people up to my room at any one time, ... This just strikes me as strange for a hotel that costs $200+ a night. What I did l like about my room was that it was spacious, had plenty of light elements (lamps, shades, wall lights), had a huge curtain that I could pull across the bathroom/foyer to block additional noise coming from the hallway, the fact that I didn't hear the loud techno music coming from the club downstairs (some W hotels suffer from the fact that even if you are on a high floor it can be very loud), and the Bliss bath products. What I didn't like about my room (and was probably specific to my room) was that the AC unit did not work. Not a deal breaker only because the temperature was pretty mild in Dallas but definitely annoying as I had checked in so late and was too tired to make any complaints to fix the issue.
UR127632938	The wife and I decided to spend a much-deserved getaway weekend in Dallas. Securing tickets for the Dallas Mavericks for both Friday night and Sunday afternoon games, it made logical sense to choose logding closeby the American Airline Center(AAC). Located literally across the street from the AAC, the W Dallas Victory Hotel was a perfect fit. However, having never been to the W, we were somewhat puzzled by the whimsical design (refered to elsewhere as "trendy"); nonetheless a nice doorman finally recognized our disorientation and guided us to registration. We only made the Friday game tipoff in time because of the convenient valet parking and the W's easy walk to the AAC. Returning to our room, we analyzed our accommodations more closely. There was hardly any closet space whatsoever, hidden behind a mirrored door. My wife gave up and just lived out of her suitcase rather than to fight with me over the limited storage in the closet. The king-sized bed we requested precluded us from being assigned a room with a bathtub (as only double bed roooms offered tubs). The "open floor design" provided no separation between the bathroom facilities with its glass-walled shower space and the guest room itself. The shower had no door; consequently, there was a never-ending chilling breeze that continually swept across your wet naked body while using the shower space--making clean-up time needlessly unpleasant and necessarily brief. (Perhaps this is the W's "trendy" way to minimize water consumption?!?!) There were winestains(?) on the carpet, but overall the room itself seemed clean otherwise. The view via the outside windows was admittedly entertaining; however, it would have been even nicer if the exterior surface of the windows had been cleaned more recently. We did not attend the bar nor the hotel restaurant. However, we did meet friends at a nearby Moroccan restaurant that was excellent, within easy walking distance. There were several nearby shoppes as well that provided suitable momentary diversions as we strolled about Downtown Dallas. An unexpected pleasure was the exhibition in the AAC parking lot of the newly christened NASA space capsule dubbed the "Orion"! Two astronauts and several helpful assistants were on hand to explain the vessel's spacetravel features, offer complimentary brochures, mission patches, logo pins, and to sign autographs. Visitors were even allowed to sign the outside of this model, to show support for the continuation of space exploration. A very nice gesture of the hotel valet parking, understanding our purpose to attend the afternoon basketball game across the street, was to allow us to remain parked within the hotel valet parking even though we were required to check out of our room before gametime. This consideration was worth a star on the rating system by itself! We probably will return to the W Hotel in the future because we are loyal Mavericks fans. However, we will probably opt for one of the corner rooms that end in the numbers "01", as we were told these have an outside balcony and are constructed with a more favorable roomier layout. We'll update this review after we revisit, provided the Mavericks make the playoffs!
UR127531142	I would like to start out by saying I am a HUGE fan of The Starwood Properties and always try to stay in a St. Regis or W whenever I travel. I WAS an even bigger fan of the Dallas W....having stayed there at least four times since it opened and even chosing to have my Bachelorette Weekend there back in September. I think it's losing it's touch..... I personally love the "sparkle factor" of the hotel. I think the spa with steam shower, pool, and overall feel is just fabulous. But upon staying there last weekend...something felt off. First of all...we were upgraded to a "Spectacular Room" for being Starwood Gold but it really was not much different than their base level rooms. The wear and tear is REALLY starting to show. Our mini bar was scratched up, there were multiple dings and dents in the wood furntiure, and it did not seem as though it was being maintained. Our hot/cold knob in the shower actually PULLED OFF in my husband's hand as he was attempting to adjust the water temperatue. My husband was also really surprised that the TV channels were not in HD which is something you would expect for a "five star" property. We encountered a few problems with our stay which also left a bad taste in our mouths......first of all the remote control didn't work. A new one was sent up promptly but still frustrating...the remote and TV also looked like they were very late models...think 1998..... Secondly on TWO occasions our room keys did not work. My husband and I both separately had to go down to the desk to get new keys made as we were told "a cell phone or some form of magnetic strip" deactivated the card. WHAT?! I have stayed at over 50 hotels in my life and have NEVER had this situation occur.....and have never been given such a strange explanation. Of course we are going to carry our room key in our purse, pocket, or wallet...which might also have our cell phone near it. So. Very. Strange. The worst part about when my key didnt work was I was on my way back from the spa wearing nothing but my white robe and slippers. IMAGINE my frustration coming back down to the front desk half naked to have a new key made. REALLY annoying! Other than those issues...almost everything else was fine...we used the pool...service was just OK in terms of getting drinks and food...the car service is nice and our driver was great...and probably the best service of the entire hotel....funny because I think the drivers are contracted out. I know the hotel was only built a few years ago...but I think it's time for a little TLC and a complete overhaul of their "room key" system. Sadly, this was my last trip to my favorite Dallas hotel. I will be at Zaza or Ritz from now on......
UR127263343	For those that like W hotel style, you will most likely like it. I am not a huge fan, the rooms are not really designed in a way I would find practical, but have to say that everything was clean, service was good, food was good. The view from the bar on one of the high floors was really nice and a nice place for a drink there. Location was also a plus. I stayed there in June 2011, it was actually so busy due to NBA finals, so considering this, it was not that bad, expected much worse as terms of service etc. I would say it is better average, by staying here, you will not regret, but by staying elsewhere, you will be OK too :-)
UR126873163	I stayed here for 3 nights while on business and it's a beautiful swanky hotel (expected nothing less from the W). I thought the reception area was located in a weird place (the staff is not facing you as you walk in). I didn't get the room I reserved (King bed) but I just went back down to reception to get the correct room and it worked out fine. Lighting in all W hotels is very dim and that would be my only complaint. I like nicely lit, airy rooms but the room only had enough light during the daytime. We ate at Craft one night which I LOVED. Deliciously prepared dishes with food that's from local farms. There are also good restaurant options which are a short stroll away so I would definitely stay here again if I'm in Dallas for business or pleasure.
UR126502443	The W Victory Dallas has all of the essentials of a top full service hotel- location, great restaurants, exceptional cleanliness and energized atmosphere. The rooms are of good size and decor is very modern. Room amenities are from their own Bliss spa and have everything from foaming facial scrub to luxe body lotion. The hotel restaurant is 'craft' featuring only seasonal fresh ingredients and no sauces. My favorite feature of the hotel was the fitness center located on the 17 floor with a panoramic view of the Dallas skyline. The lobby bar is fun and funky and has a club feel after dark. I would stay here for business or leisure and never consider another hotel when visiting Dallas .
UR126234828	Modern hotel. I don't like this new W layout where the bathroom and the room are in the same space and where you enter the room through the bathroom - makes me feel like I'm sleeping in the bathroom. That said, the room and amenities were as expected with a W Hotel: nice bed, Bliss products, good shower and fast Internet. Gym was modern and well maintained, room service ok and concierge helpful. Doesn't feel particularly luxurious but good for business travel.
UR125680610	The people who worked there were so chic I thought they might be actors. The low voltage blue lights set a seriously sophisticated mood. The guests that were drawn to the property fit right in. The food was excellent. Craft Steakhouse (great) was on premises, as was the ghost bar (great). There is a real full service spa and a roof top pool. The rooms are funky and modern. The suites are huge. This is not your dad's hotel. I stay here every time I'm in Dallas
UR125470142	Stayed for a weekend recently, room 1527 I believe. It was a top floor corner suite. Clean nice room, the huge shower and bath tub were the highlight. Michael at the concierge desk was extremely helpful in planning our weekend!
UR124910334	First off, we had nothing but 5 star customer service from the minute we pulled up in the drive. A gentlemen was there to great us, explain the valet or self park options, while unloading our luggage. He passed us on to the next fellow holding a door open and greeting us. Once inside we were immediately welcomed, directed to the check in desk and were asked if we needed any water or anything to drink. Our room was beautiful as expected. The decor throughout the property is wonderful and very modern. The room had plenty of space to move around. Loved the lounge/couch. We ordered room service late at night and it arrived so fast. It was hot and really quite good. The only thing wrong with our stay was that we did not have the munchie box in our room that is supposed to accompany the mini-bar. No idea where that might have walked off too. Every interaction we had at the W was top notch. Some day maybe we'll get to stay longer than a single night!
UR124838338	This hotel represents the W name as far as looks. With valet being the only option to park your vehicle, they did a very good job of welcoming me to the hotel. I was then directed to the front desk which was a dissapoinment. I had reserved two rooms and they had only one reserved for me. The girl at the front desk treated me as if I made the mistake. After me finding my reservation that I made showing two rooms, she then fixed the problem. The following morning went downstairs to enjoy breakfast at Kraft, only to sit there for 10 minutes to not be waited on. It was a very busy morning, but I only saw two wait staff and a hostess. No sign of management at all. So I walked out. The staff at this W, just seemed to lack direction and enthusiasm. The positive was the clean Sweat room(workout) and the heated pool that sits on the 16th floor.
UR124696218	I had the pleasure of staying at the W Dallas Victory during a valentines day trip with my wife. What I can say is that this property is clean, fresh, and in true W style - cool! We had a spectacular room on the 9th floor. It had really nice views of the city, very cool bathroom in the room. We love Bliss so we def enjoyed the amenities.For breakfast we dined at Craft. We enjoyed 2 lattes which were among the best ive had! We also had eggs benedict and french toast with vanilla spread..delicious!! We had a few 'sips' in living room and also had dinner there as Craft closed early for their belated holiday party. The salmon was generous and fresh and the pasta was homemade and authentic, the scallops were fantastic as well. The staff was very acommodating and were eager to help. The Acura car service took us to the Museum of Art which is a great amenity for guests, ride through Dallas in style! All in all really enjoyed staying at the W ane cant wait to stay at other properties in the future.
UR124224305	Went for 2 nights for a wedding and was stunned! The venue options for the wedding were amazing, the rooms were outstanding (though the style of connecting bathroom is kinda weird) the restaurant CRAFT was perfect and finally the Ghost bar upstairs was a great icing on the cake!!! Staff were the best ive came across by far!! p.s. The beds are realllllllly comfortable!!
UR123893286	Excellent location, flawless service, beautiful rooms, amazing property and amenities, I dont know where to begin on how wonderful this hotel is. Ive stayed at a few of the W hotels across the country and this one is definitely one of the best. If your familiar with the Dallas - Fort Worth area metroplex, you'll see that the hotels location is perfect for business or pleasure. Located right on the outskirts of downtown and near uptown, its right by all major highways and access to other parts of the city and surrounding cities. Its literally right next door to the American Airlines Center so if your in town for an event, concert, or sporting game (Dallas, Mavericks or Dallas Stars) its absolutely perfect. You can walk across the street and not have to deal with traffic or parking. Located in the same block as the arena and also directly next door to the hotel is one of the news studios for WFAA Channel 8 where they shoot live news segments and shows daily so you may have a chance to get on tv sometimes or you may see one of your favorite artists or one of their special guests in the studio during the taping or airing of the show. All in all, that area is a pretty cool experience. Sometimes it feels like a mini times square when there is a really big event going on at the arena. Also surrounding the arena and hotel and really nice bars, lounges and restaurants, along with another upscale residential property so it stays pretty busy and upbeat. A good place for 20 to 30 somethings to enjoy themselves. Down the opposite direction of the street are a few more residential properties and small stores attached to the W hotel property on the block. At the farthest end of one of the W residential towers is the House of Blues, which is always jumping and is an EXCELLENT place for a live show or even dinner and drinks. There's also a Hooters right across the street from that (the biggest Hooters location in the nation. with the best looking staff, i might add) And there is also a brand new Hard Rock Cafe on the adjoining block to that. Which is massive as well and is a great spot for a business lunch or to catch a game on tv. Now, all that plus more I didnt mention is all in walking distance to the hotel so you can literally stay down there and do zero driving if your just in town for fun. Ive stayed there for a month last year and i think i took a cab once a week to a location in the middle of downtown for business meetings. Theres more restaurants within a quick cab ride away and the uptown area of dallas is nearby as well which is filled with trendy lounges, clubs, restaurants, stores, gyms, etc. Its the best part of Dallas with the most going on. Needless to say, the location is CHOICE! Your going to love it. The hotel itself is something to see. Its huge and is retro fitted with the standard W styling of super modern and extra fancy. Its got a slick lobby area and a sexy hotel bar called the Library Bar that has a trendy vibe and a really nice patio. They have guest dj's from time to time and sometimes do special happy hour events. Its a good place to go unwind before or after resting up in your room. The hotel has a top notch restaurant called Craft which is always amazing and never lets me down. I usually do my nicer dinners there then order room service if i need to and eat out in the surrounding places that i can walk to (hooters, hard rock, neros pizza, etc) If your into the club/lounge scene then this hotel will be perfect because on the top floor is the Ghostbar. Its the W hotels staple club establishment and is usually rocking the roof off. The only other ghostbar better than this would have to be in Vegas cause this place is amazing. If you've been to one then you know, they are nice. This one has a huge see thru patio on the outside with a bar attached so you can see straight down below while your hanging out up there. I think its something around 33 floors up in the air. Pretty sweet to see. The hotel amenities are all great. All that plus excellent room service (the food is actually really really good), an AMAZING pool area and wet deck, and a really nice gym, all makes this place basically a one stop shop for all your travel, relaxation, and party needs. Oh and i think there's spa on the first floor but Ive never paid much attention to it. Its past the elevators so when i arrive i usually just go straight to my room without going near the spa area. ha The staff is always impressive and does an excellent job at making sure the stay is an enjoyable one. Its strictly private access to the rooms so if you have visitors, the front desk will call you to either come down to meet with them or they will give buzz them up. Makes it pretty handy to limit traffic flow of people who may not actually being staying at the hotel. (noise, solicitation, etc) Lets see, the rooms! The rooms are always amazing and are SUPER comfortable. They are equipped with just about everything you will need and anything else you can just call the front desk and they will deliver it directly to your room. Ive ordered everything from an mp3 cord to plug in my mp3 player to the clock radio device, to a pack of cigarettes, to a 12 pack of beer, to a wine cooler. You name it, they will either already have it on hand or will get it for you. The beds are super comfy and come in standard queen or king sizes. There's a small chair or lounger in each room with a small desk, dry bar area, 32" or 40" flat screen, alarm clock mp3 ipod player device, 2 phones, and a nice separate bathroom area. The bathroom area includes toiletries, and a nice robe and linens. The rooms themselves always feel alot bigger in comparison to similar hotel chains around the same price. Ive stayed in both the double queen with 3 other people and the king suite just to myself and they always feel like i have a ton of room. Oh, they are also always super clean too. the bedroom area and the bathrooms are always spotless and look like they've never even been used. Overall, if your looking to stay somewhere nice and really do it up. Stay here. You get alot of bang for your buck and you'll never be disappointed. Its a rockin spot to stay and is definitely my go-to place in Dallas.
UR123675482	We love the W Dallas... everything you need, is in one place! The Lounge is a great place to start your evening. Followed by dinner at Craft, and dancing at the Ghost Bar! The views from Ghost are fabulous! Staff is very accommodating.... especially the "whatever,whenever" service! My boyfriend, had a lil too much fun, and they went to the store, for crackers and 7-up. Now that's service! The hotel is very modern and chic. The pool is gorgeous with great views too! And room service is always incredible!
UR123599897	I stayed here last April and the staff was extremely helpful in referring dining and activities, the room was super chic, bed unbelievably comfortable, and the overall experience was fantastic. We also had our Westie with us, and the staff couldn't have been nicer to him! We ended up getting a great deal on expedia, and we couldn't have been happier!
UR123323290	Great choice if you're in Dallas on business. We stayed for a convention which provided shuttle-service to/from the hotel. There were properties available closer to the convention center, but that area of the city and downtown Dallas seemed dead in the evening. The W Victory was within walking distance to a variety of good local restaurants and to the West End Historic District. The hotel bar was hopping on most nights with a good crowd and there was a decent sports bar across the street as well. The biggest disappointment involved breakfast: limited and rather pricey at the hotel lounge (but coffee is free) and no establishments close-by that served breakfast.
UR123185174	We booked around 8 rooms for a weekend of Hockey and family fun. Check in they were very cold, only one person checking people in and there was a line. Another finally showed up. Got to room and it was fine. Needed to ask about late checkout, hit the whatever/whenever button and NO ONE ever answered! This was a Sat. around 12:30pm - really? Pool was closed for repairs on Saturday and then Sunday they drained it - no oppportunity for kids to swim....on a weekend....really? We were told complimentary bagels, muffins, coffee, etc....in morning but got down there and it was only tea and coffee complimentary. Restaurant for breakfast did not open til 8am. Convenience to AAC is great. Lobby is small, only place to hook up with groups is outside or in bar area. Not group or family friendly. Would not do this hotel again.
UR122786666	I would not recommend this hotel. The front desk staff was very rude. I had an issue checking in and the employee checking me in was too scared to tell me so she had to go get her equally rude manager. Unless you are dressed up or wearing a suit you get looked down upon. Ive stayed here before and the room was ok but not worth having to deal with the staff.
UR122241016	I've stayed here twice now and loved it both times. The hotel rooms are so clean and I love their shampoos and soaps! The bed is very comfortable and I love the atmosphere here.
UR122199752	First let me say I like the concept of the hotel. The decor is fascinating and very different from other hotels. The lobby lounge is beautiful and the hotel's location is great. But is this somewhere I want to stay for several days? Not so much. The rooms are tiny, tiny, tiny. Other luxury hotels in Dallas offer much larger rooms. And the bathroom offers no privacy whatsoever. The water closet has a door but the sink/shower had no privacy! They are trying very hard to make the atmosphere very "clubby," playing loud music in the lobby and elevators. Maybe it makes sense for a bachelor party or college weekend, but for a romantic getaway or business trip, I'll pass. We didn't eat at the restaurant so I can't comment, but we did use the pool and spa. The rooftop pool was very nice. Not a huge area to lay out and the water was freezing (in September when I went) but it was neat to be on the roof and it had a nice bar. I will post a separate review of the Bliss Spa but I have to say it wasn't my favorite. It's more of a "busy girl in the city" spa than a go spend the whole day relaxing spa.
UR121901325	The major issues here have been housek eeping. Two days in a row we have placed dirty towels and robes in the bath tub. First day they were left there second day they had picked them up and just dumped them on the bedroom floor. Our fridge was unplugged and phone didn't work, we had to ask twice to get these fixed. When we got to the room our mirror had two handprints on it and what looked like dried 'body fluid' on it , 2 days in its still there. Generally when u stay in a W you expect something special , this is like a high rise La Quinta
UR121195510	We were in a wonderfull room with a city view,it was spacious and much like the pictures already available in other reviews here. Because it was november,there seemed to be no activity in the pool area but it's as nice in real life as it looks in the pictures. Theres a night club right up at roof level that was very busy when we were there as was the bar down at the ground level. Service was very good and with a smile all the time. I liked breakfast in the main restaurant downstairs.Very tasty! It doesn't look like a W there but other parts like the lobby and main bar are very W in style as is the welcome you get when you check in.."So what is going on in Dallas this evening?" That seems to be the question everyone was asked. The hotel is near enough to many bars and nice restaurants such that you would be able to walk to them. Incidently whilst there was a hip and party like athmosphere and a young feel to the clientelle at the hotel when we were there.We did not experience any hassle with people going wild in the hallways or general rowdyism at all.Everything was very pleasant and a good nights sleep was had.
UR120907667	This was the second W hotel I stayed at and it lived up to my very high expectations. W Hotels are not for anyone who want a quiet, boring hotel experience. You definitely need to enter with a sense of adventure. With that in mind, the whole experience is unique and incredible. Everything about our stay was great - the views of downtown Dallas, the cool room and bathroom, the service, CRAFT, Living Room, Ghost Bar - I could go on and on. The weather wasn't good enough for us to use the pool, but it seemed very nice. If you have never stayed at a W, it's definitely worth trying. If you have, then you'll enjoy the Dallas W just as much!
UR120790618	I have top tier status at Starwood hotels so I typically would try to stay at a Starwood property if possible (for the various benefits and points). I was traveling to Dallas on a weekly basis for work during this summer and tried to give this W Hotel a try for 3 separate occasions. Each time a new issue would come up (from being given rooms that was absolutely not what I had reserved, to terrible service at front desk, to issues with room service and potentially dirty food). In my subsequent visits to Dallas, I have switched to staying at the Ritz-Carlton which is exponentially better, for a similar price.
UR120629489	We live in North Dallas and spend one two too nights out on runaways a year in the area, Granbury, Jefferson, ZaZA downtown. Tried the W because we read about all the hype. First our door key did not work and it took maintenance about an hour to fix the lock. The hotel is probably in a good spot if you are going to AAA but other than that its in a concrete wasteland. To eat we checked our car out of valet, no free parking, and drove down to the McKinney area which was great. The windows were filthy with scum which destroyed the view, bath fixtures were tacky and not quality, tub small as was the bath, a room that would fit in a La Quinta, nothing more. We were hoping for a fun downtown experience but the poor room, bad location and blase attitude of the staff turned us off big time. Pass this one by.
UR120556824	There is no where to other than the parking gaeage across the street, which is not owned by the hotel. The valet and parking garage are pretty much evenly priced. The hotel is next to the basketball arena, but seems not be close to anything else or walkable distance. The elevators are slow to arrive. The rooms are contemporary and had a view of outside dallas. The ghost bar is okay. There is no seating in the inside unless you pay for bottles. There is seating outside unless you want sit in the heat if there are seats available. The music is typical of a club. The crowd is mixed of ethnicities and starts at 21 to older. There is no fee for women but an outrageous fee for males. The hotel continues to be a club during the night. The pool stayed open after hours with no guard. The view in the pool was spectacular.
UR120535004	Staying approximately 140 nights per year in SPG hotels the W's are usually my favorites. Most probably just had bad luck at the W in Dallas. Did not get a room upgrade as I usually do, close to my room was a strange high-frequency tone and even dow I was able to shut off the AC the fan was still running and being noisy the whole time. Service at the Craft restaurant I'm sure would be able to be more friendly even on a Sunday morning. Travel long a lot to Dallas in the future I will give it another try, can only become better.
UR120333776	Very nice hotel and excellent staff. Always feel welcomed and everything is always in tip-top shape. First rate all around!!! I have stayed at a lot of other hotels but the W Dallas staff works 10x harder and values you as a resident.
UR120228469	Very nice hotel and the rooms are to die for! Nice big comfy bed, clean bath, perfect location.
UR119682179	Our first room smelled horrible, I think someone had thrown-up. They put a deoderizer in the room and we had to leave for over an hour, and it still smelled when we returned. They moved us to a different floor and the rooms are so small. I have stayed at so many nicer hotels that did not cost near as much as the W. The security is insane like they are used to dealing with spring breakers, and almost all of the employees have bad attitudes. They try to steer you to their own restaurants which, like the rooms, are over priced They offer to drop you at a nearby restaurant or club, but then there is no one available. At 3:30 am I awoke to what I thought was a riot in the hallway. It continued until about 5 and I got up to check on the noise. It was coming from three or more people having a loud argument in the next room. Very disappointing experience.The rooms are so overpriced and the atmosphere was not the slightest bit comfortable.
UR119199197	As with all W hotels, you can expect great design and an overall degree of "coolness". But this W Hotel also excels in friendliness and helpfullness. From the Valet and Bellhops, to Doormen who actually open doors, this is a warm and welcoming hotel. As for the room, the amenities, bedding, and fixturing are all first rate.
UR119040321	I thought this place was really nice. They have a shuttle car that will drive u in a 2 mile radius which is helpful. Trolley is a short walk away and takes you to the West Village a little boutique area of shopping and food. Pool here was very nice with beautiful views and bliss products are very nice.
UR118974694	My wife and I arrived at the W for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. When we arrived, parking was not a problem. The valet service was quick. The front desk girl was friendly and accommodating. She informed us that our room was upgraded which excited us, of course. Entering the room, we were disappointed with the size. It was normal if not smaller that what you would get a Holiday Inn. The couch in the room had cigarette burns. Also, probably the biggest problem was that the shower did not work properly. It either scalded you or was ice freezing cold, there was no happy medium. When we notified the operator, they said they would send someone up to look at it but there wouldn't be much else they could do. However, I do have to say when we checked out; they reduced our bill to half for our troubles which we still paid over $200.
UR118620641	Not at this hotel, form follows? Nary a drawer or a hook to hang a wet bathing suit on. I thought most people stayed at hotels over a night or more, does everyone just live out of a suitcase? I prefer a few drawers.
UR118234628	I have the pleasure of staying here on business frequently. In my many stays, one thing that stands out is consistent excellent service.
UR118095223	First off: We really love the W brand and have stayed at several of their properties before. However, besides some issues that exist chain wide, this one was exceptionally disappointing: First off, the area it is located in is everything but exciting though we're not sure if there's anything that we would particularly like in Texas. Then, it's quite love-less for a W, both service-and design wise, not very spectacular from the outside, not particularly special in the rooms. Our room was a fairly large and expensive one but it let us down on several levels that we wouldn't expect from a W, mouldy corners in the bathroom and toilet, left-over painter's tape on the shower head and a broken door in the wardrobe not allowing the thing to ever close properly. The worst bit, however, was the pool: Horrid atmosphere and full of drunk red necks having a party- besides the water was completely milky and yuck. Another issue as in most Ws was the so called "What ever, when ever" service that never seems to deserve its name: If you promise something like that, you surely should back it up at least to a degree? We followed the instructions found on a little card in a room "If you want a coffee maker delivered to your room, simply dial the Whatever whenever button". Yea- if it was so easy! First no one picked up. Then we were promised to get one and waited for 15 minutes. Called again, another wait. Finally received a free coffee from room service to make up for it but seriously: If "what ever when ever" can't do THAT, I wonder what they do if you ask for anything more than what would be expected anyway in a room of this price range? Not good enough but typical for Ws in general in our experience. Oh- one really good thing: The restaurant downstairs was absolutely lovely, great food and totally unexpected in this city. Super-pricey though, just be warned.
UR117545901	Every year I have a "me weekend" of about 4 days at the W Hotel Dallas. The staff from the front lines to behind the scenes are efficient and polite. This hotel caters more to the younger set (20-30 year old's), but I must say that the same courtesy was extended to me(a 52 year old) as the younger guests. I used all the hotel services including Bliss Spa and must say it was exceptional. The pool is thee place on the weekend, so be prepared as you will not get the peace and quiet you desire.
UR117499193	Wife's 30th bday getaway. Always greeted with exceptional service, from valet to the front desk. We didn't have to wait and you could tell it was a busy day for the hotel at check in. Room was ready, clean, spacious, and great view. Amanda at the front desk couldn't have been friendlier and more welcoming. Spent the day @ the W Pool. Great atmosphere and drinks. Service from Lacy was top notch. Dined at Craft that evening and crushed it. Pork Belly as an appetizer is a must as are the short ribs. If I had the funds I would by the bed and bedding. Best night of sleep I've had in ages. Will stay again.
UR117416098	Not my favorite of the W properties. The location is not the greatest and they combine with a residence. Most all of the retail stores that were below them have vacated and Dallas is not really a walking town. So as far as location goes - not the best. Rooms are fine enough - the attention and service is not as good as other W's. Next time in Dallas will probably stay at a more centrally located hotel. If you are looking for a true "W" experience - you will only get part of one at the Dallas Victory.
UR117150379	As with most W hotels, the W Dallas Victory is a lovely property, with hip rooms. I was on the 15th floor, and had a great view, and the cool floorplan meant that the open bathroom was the first thing I walked into, and made everything feel spacious (see photos). I loved the bathroom (as normal with W), and appreciated the toilet closet (love those), and the huge walk-in shower. Bliss bath products are also always a treat. There were a few problems that really bothered me though: 1 - Wifi was spotty all night long, and completely failed for a few hours in the morning. As a business traveller this was a major issue, and they should have fixed it more quickly. 2 - my duvey cover had some big stains on them. Yuck! why wouldnt' they have noticed and switched them out?? 3 - the Ghost Bar was closed. In this part of town, there are few things happening if there isn't a sports event, so their cool hotel bar should have been open. Other than that, a nice stay and a good property. Just fix a few things and it's 5-star!
UR117109267	My husband surprised me with a night at the W during a weekend trip to Dallas for my birthday. I was so excited when we pulled up (he had kept it a secret until then), my husband had booked a package on expedia which included valet parking, 2 drinks and the room. Upon check in they didn't have record of the package and acted like my husband was lying until he dug out the copy of the expedia confirmation. I felt like the room itself was really small for the cost, also in order to get a bath tub we had to get a room with 2 queens which was wierd to me. My husband had called to ask if the tub was large enough for 2 and was told yes, hahaha... maybe 2 kids! The thing that really made me not want to stay here again is that the hotel basically turns into a big club at night, full of drunk people. We were trying to have a romantic getaway and at 11pm we finally had enough and called the front desk to change rooms because there were constantly drunk people getting off the elevator screaming up and down our hallway. The front desk did move us and after that it was fine. Overall I think this place is waaaay overpriced! It was nice and clean but I think we will try somewhere a little less trendy next time.
UR116862588	This hotel was great. the bar downstairs was always busy and the pool up top is great. The rooms are spotless and the service is excellent. My only complaint is the pool bar closes at 6pm!!! they are losing out on so much service!
UR116637098	Our weekend staycation at W Dallas was all that we had hoped for and more. Dinner at craft was amazing, with both great food and service. (Try the braised beef shortribs!) We enjoyed probably the best massages of our lives at Bliss spa. The pool was beautiful and not overly crowded, with a nice lunch menu and great bartenders. We also took advantage of the comp. car service for dinner our second evening. The concierge was very helpful. We'll be back!
UR116523314	I loved everything about this hotel! I loved the huge, fashionable decorated rooms I was in, Loved the view, Loved how everyone was just so eager to make my Weekend Birthday Celebration a great one, whether it was the hostess/host, concierge, bartenders, waitstaff or valet. It was a great trip and I will definitely be back!
UR116188743	I 've been to several W hotels around the country and so far they all exceeded my expectation and more but the most recent stay wasnt a pleasant experience. We stayed there on a Sunday, check in was fast and efficient. Got a room on the 12 floor which was good. We came into the room to find out that the floor lamp wasn't working, also the ipod dock too. We didn't want to call the front desk to fix them since we only stay there for one night and was so tired anyway. I still don't understand how a nice hotel like the W would have fixtures in the room that don't work. After we settled in we decided to go for the swim at the hotel pool on the 16 floor because we love it so much last time we stayed. When we get to the pool the was a security guy stood there just like a bouncer in front of a club. He then demanded that each of us had to have a room key in order to get into the pool. First of all we only brought one room key with us since we didn't feel the need to carry many keys. Second of all it is just a pool, not a club i don't see why there has to be a security to check everyone in. I have stayed at quite a lot of hotels but this is the first time I encountered this. We felt offended and lost our mood completely and turn back to our room. So next time you stay here and wanna go for a swim remember to bring all the room keys with you, since security has to check every single person in.
UR116135251	Lovely hotel; great customer service - give guest cold bottle of water at reception upon check in; nice room; a driver in a luxury SUV (Acura) took me to my place of business; nice coffee shop for breakfast; great stay!
UR115766029	My girlfriend came in town for the weekend and we had a great time at the W. The pool was perfect for the Texas-heat and the rooms were super comfy. Service was top notch as well. we'll def be back again.
UR115368892	W is one of the brands I like. Been to many. Why this hotel is a joke I have no idea. You are basically on your own. Service is NON-EXISTENT. Repeat NON EXISTENT. 0. None. - Waitress rolled her eyes at us when we asked for a menu at pool bar. - "Whatever Whenever" can't answer a simple question. Then takes two-three of your own calls to find out what's up. Be prepared for no one to never ever follow up. Ever! -Valet watches you unload and load. Arms crossed. Three of them outside just watching. Servicing guest is something they are unfamiliar with. One valet got so aggressive I was concerned for my safety. - Ignored at Bar. Even after being a regular guest nightly. -Frat boy unsophisticated party crowd. Guys with shirts off in elevators, girls in bikinis wasted running around. So bad they have police in the lobby on the weekend. What hotel hires police? This one does. -The attitude and constant failure of the staff becomes a comedy at best. -A Holiday Inn would be a better option than this wanna be W. This is NOT A W hotel. If it is, then W is now the lamest brand out there. -"Whatever Whenever you expect service... Uh, don't. Did I mention the cock roach in the bar? I warned you.
UR115299394	When the negative reviews keep saying the same thing (dating back 3+ years), you'd think the hotel management might listen and try to address some of those things. Not the case here, they seem content to keep pasting the same message asking people to call them so they can discuss. Some things can't be easily changed, I get that, such as the terrible shower/bathroom design, the cheap "Ikea-like" furniture, the views of rooftops and empty lots, etc... Many hotels have similar problems. It wouldn't take much effort to clean the place up a bit and make sure everything works though. We had a burnt out light, a remote that was dead, an iPod dock that didn't work and an air conditioner that sounded like a semi roaring down I35 cutting on and off all night, even though the temp couldn't have been within 10 degrees of what it claimed to be. Combine that with the hidden hotel directory (mentioned several times here), the semi-clean room (fingerprints and dust everywhere) and the high priced snacks, and you'd be better off at any # of hotels in the area. Basically, this is a hotel for the 20-30 year olds to party in, and they do it all night up and down the halls. If that's your crowd, you'll love this place. I will complement the valet guys and front desk check in, they were on top of things and very fast. Don't expect a smile when stopping by the Whatever - Whenever desk though, even a simple task of checking us out of our room (since our remote didn't work we couldn't checkout via the TV) seemed to put a cramp in their style.
UR115214619	The manager could not give us a straight story on why the pool on the 16th floor was closed. She would say it should open soon, but never did. The the employees at the front desk were rude and not friendly. The rooms are way over priced and some of the outlets and lights did not work as well as the mini fridge was broken too.
UR115198801	we been celebrating my wife B-Day, and was looking for something special, I booked a room and was under the impression "it is just another nice place" however, when the hotel management heard about the occasion, we have been given a special treatment, so in one word, amassing, I will recommend and will visit there any time I can. Thanks for the stuff and especially to Nina Ashmore. BTW, the Craft restaurant at the first floor is also recommended.
UR114796073	I LOVE the W hotel. All of the staff are so professional, and kind! I had everything I needed. It felt like I never had to lift a finger. The best part? the WET DECK! It is so peaceful up there! I've never seen such a beautiful pool on the roof top of a building. They also have the Luminous Envy Tanning Float free to their guests to use! There is also this spa on the 16th floor called bliss that will blow your mind! Amazing Amazing Amazing! I live in Dallas, but I will come to this hotel for a mini vacation over and over!
UR114795669	1. Location - good, next to the AA arena, if you want to walk to downtown, its abt 15 min. Easy drive to and from the expressway, easy to find. 2. Parking - valet, $24, reasonable. 3. Front desk - extremely personable, very efficient. Made reservations in the spa at check-in, gave a couple bottles of water, followed up with a call to make sure that the room was acceptable. 4. Room - spacious, comfortable. Love seat by the window was a nice touch. Bed very comfortable as well. The only issue was the shower. It is half enclosed, and does tend to spill to the floor around, but it was not that big of a deal. I could not get it to be normal warm temperature, it was either too hot or too cold. 5. Swimming pool - on the 16th floor, with bar service, lounge chairs... Amazing for relaxation, not crowded at all in three days that I spent there. Mojitos that the bartender made were pure alcohol! Views as good as it gets in Dallas (there is not much of a view anywhere there). 6. The bar on the 33rd floor - good drinks, very good service, has an outside area with good views and a cool breeze. Dedicated elevator from the lobby. Overall, definitely a hotel I would stay at again in Dallas.
UR114586015	From the moment I pulled up on the front drive to the moment I left- the hotel and service were FIVE STAR! The bellman even offered to drive me to a nearby restaurant in his own car! as the weather was very warm outside. The room was clean, the lobby lounge service was flawless, the room service was piping hot! EVERYTHING was PERFECT! And trust me, I am a very! very! very! pickey traveler!!!!!!!! I will be back and often! The W Dallas Victory Hotel was AMAZING!
UR114332571	I'm a business traveller that spends over 200 nights in hotels a year so keep that in mind when reading my reviews. THE GOOD I'm actually very surprised about the bad reviews people give about this property. I've been staying here since it opened and usually have not had any problems and the staff has always been friendly. I've stayed at W Hotels all around the world and they are all generally modern and usually attracts a certain scene so people should know what to expect when staying here. Beds are standard W softness, the showers have a strong consistent flow, the pool is exceptional, and the overall finish of the hotel is W quality. My favorite part about this hotel though is the gym. Perfect for business travelers who want to get a decent workout without having to sign up for a gym nearby. Room service is delicious, but also some good dining nearby. THE BAD My reservation got bumped recently because of overbooking from the NBA finals. I was obviously not happy about this and called the Director of Revenue Management and really gave it to him. To his credit he took it professionally and apologized which was all I was looking for. They rebooked me at another nearby Starwood hotel and gave me 20K points, and then upgraded me to their nicest suite the next time round. THE UGLY None.
UR112671645	I have stayed in many 5 stars including Ritz-Carltons, Four Seasons, St. Regis, and others and have never had better attention and treatment than here at W Victory. Amanda and the front desk crew were above and beyond with personal and specialized treatment during my stay at a very busy time during the NBA playoffs. The valet when I pulled up, the bellman, the bartender, waitress, all were exceptional. Most referred to me by name and were the most professional I have ever witnessed.
UR112315258	I travel internationally for business/pleasure, and this W does not live up to the W standard I'm accustomed to. The room service is sub-par, the pool deck doesn't get sun (not that you'd want to see most Dallas people in swimwear), smoke permeates the entrance, and the staff will attempt to rip you off. I booked a sedan through the concierge - to drop me off at a wedding, and they ended up charging me for 5 hours. Stay elsewhere, or skip Dallas altogether.
UR112117435	I stay at this property at least once a month on business. While it's not the closest hotel to my work location, I like it because travelling on business is no fun, but this property always makes me feel at home. From the bellman at the front door, to the folks who deliver room service, to the waiters at Craft and the masseuse at Bliss, each is professional, accomodating and pleasant to be around. And I love that ~2 days prior to my arrival, I always receive an email asking me if there's anything I need or anything hey should prep for my visit. They take this very seriously. The rooms are appointed with everything you would find in your own home, from down comforters to ipod docking stations as well as your own munchie station should you require a late night snack. My favorite though are the Bliss bath products. It's like having a spa in your room, should you choose not to make an appointment at their fabulous spa, Bliss. The only area of the hotel that seems to need a bit of brushing up is the coordination of the staff at the front desk. No matter what time of day I check in/out, there only appears to be one person on duty. Sometimes the wait can be more than I like, but I overlook it for the rest of the property is suberb. Note, while this hotel is directly across from American Arena, there are only a few great restaurants in walking distance, so most likely you'll get into your auto to eat. Overall a great pick for work or vacation.
UR111905907	Let me start out by saying that I have stayed at many W hotels and this is definitely one of the best. The hotel was recently built (new construction) so everything at this hotel is brand new. As a Starwood platinum member I was upgraded to one of their spectacular rooms (which might actually be the same as a wonderful room on one of the upper floors). The room is not as big as you might expect, but the design is unique and they do a good job with the space they have to work with. The room is tastefully decorated with tall ceilings and the bed is one of the best in the hotel world. The lobby is amazing and very modern with plenty of seating and a fun bar off to the side. The fitness center is one of the largest I have ever seen at a hotel and is comparable to the Anytime Fitness I visit back home. The rooftop pool is worth a visit and is one of the best features of this hotel. They have an infinity pool above the hotel with a small pool bar off to the side. It lacks mid day sun since the W Residences are located above the pool, but they do get some good morning and afternoon sun for those looking for a tan. I need to give some props to the staff as they provide some of the best service in the industry. I can't say enough about how courteous and professional the staff was during my stay. I was very impressed that they were able to remember my name throughout the stay (and it was my first ever visit to this hotel). Housekeeping was wonderful and stopped by to clean my room at the time I requested. The Mavs had a playoff game the weekend I was in town and the hotel was fully booked, yet the staff seemed prepared and my stay was flawless. Thanks for a fantastic stay. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
UR110366435	W hotel-exceptionally disappointing Let me start off by saying this was my 1st experience at a W hotel & I was so excited & looking fwd to the experience! The lobby etc was nice & the front desk staff were attentive at checking us in. When we reached our floor there was a cow hide sofa plonked outside the elevator that looked completely out of place...ie in shape & colour. Secondly there was certainly no wow when we entered the rm.the colour palette was plain-neither comforting, soothing or overly appealing from an interior design perspective. The cleaning of the room left a little to be desired.on opening the refrigerator there was a dark sticky stain all throughout the bottom of it...which the cleaners obviously ignored. Likewise with the do not disturb sign-it had a big grimy coffee stain splatter all over one side. One morning I even left the sign on the bench (grimy side facing up) & the cleaners still chose to ignore it & put it back on the door still dirty! The towels were thin & 2 of them had rips on the side salvage! Certainly not acceptable for such an expensive, supposedly luxurious, quality establishment as what you come to expect of the W branding! The room service charges were astronomical-some 20% feeÂ + 18% gratuity & then an additional $3 for delivery...give me a break! The Tavern a couple of doors down did the trick as did TGIF & hard rock cafe just a 5-10 min walk away. By the way there is also a gas station within 5 minutes away where u get snacks from too. One positive was the free dropoff service somehow linked/sponsored by Acura. The most challenging part of the experience reserving the car was getting some help from one of the female W staff...ie a city map, directions, local information, DART details etc....overall the staff could have been a little more consistent accomodating the guest & just generally being helpful & friendly! All in all a really disappointing experience.
UR109185568	This hotel, as well as every other Ws, is just the greatest. The location was perfect for the games (NHL and NBA). The building is amazing and the staff is very cool and helpful. I can't wait to go back to Texas and enjoy my time at the W! OH, I forgot: great Breakfast too!
UR108266528	The W Dallas is another very regular stop for me, and I suppose I've been there at least fifty or sixty times over the past few years. The thing about the W hotels in general is their inconsistency; some are very clearly superior than others... and this discrepancy is also very clearly by design; its not that some of the hotels are incompetent, its that some are obviously designed to offer much more to guests. A great experience at one does not necessarily mean the same experience at all of them (and vice versa). Fortunately, the W Dallas has nothing to worry about in this regard, as it is frankly one of the finest in their portfolio (of which I have been to a great many). First off, it's a new construction, and seemingly no expense has been spared. The rooms are beautifully decorated and positively scream quality in every aspect, from the gorgeous bathrooms to the tastefully dark painted walls and contrasting faux-ostrich padded headboards that reach nearly all the way up to the seemingly 15' ceilings. I've had almost every kind of room in the hotel, and have not been disappointed with any of them, large or small. The lobby is amazing as well... the lounge area is gorgeous and spacious, with comfortable and luxurious seating and plenty of room to spread out (including a fantastic outdoor area), have a drink and some food, meet with friends or get some work done on your laptop. In the evenings there is often a live DJ and a crowd of very pretty people and is a lovely, low-key setting for a cocktail. On the other side of the lobby is the Craft restaurant, which is not quite as good as it's original NY incarnation, but still pretty great. Then again, Dallas has no shortage of excellent dining in general. The pool is also a highlight, located on a cutout section right in the dead-center of the building (on the same floor as the lovely Bliss spa); it's quite breathtaking, with an infinity edge that seems to go right over the side. The only drawback is that it may not be the best place for sunbathing due to it's placement... but on the other hand, direct sunlight on a summer day in Dallas can be pretty brutal, which I'm sure was taken into consideration when they designed the building. On the roof is the Ghostbar, which is kind of a letdown in comparison to all the other superlatives that the hotel has to offer. Maybe it's because I grew up in NYC and live in Manhattan, but I'm a bit of a nightlife snob, and Ghostbar doesn't quite live up to the standards to which I'm accustomed. Sure, it's worth going if you're staying in the hotel, and it's definitely considered a Dallas hotspot... but therein lies the problem. It's a fairly unsophisticated crowd, and the place was set up to cater to that clientele. The decor is pretty tacky and the giant platform space-boots they make the cocktail girls wear are more than a little ridiculous (as a side note, you will NOT find hotter cocktail waitresses anywhere on planet earth... so while their decorator should be fired, whomever is in charge of hiring those girls should be given some kind of medal). Its a shame too, because the space itself is completely breathtaking, with fantastic views and a spectacular outdoor section. With some redecorating, better promoters, and a stricter door policy, it could really be a destination unto itself. The hotel also has a staff who leave absolutely nothing to be desired. They are top-notch all the way. Literally a pleasure to deal with in every regard, from check in to check out. I have literally never had better service at a hotel anywhere else in the world. I cannot say enough good things about these people and their management... they all deserve raises, from the valets to the housekeepers. I've had numerous special requests for the concierge team, and they've come through for me with aplomb every single time... from renting me an exotic car to locating an obscure hair product, they've said yes to literally everything I've asked them to do, and did it with a smile. I've even left a shirt in my room and completely forgot about it until almost a month later... I called the concierge, who managed to track it down somehow, had it dry cleaned and then placed it in the closet of my room on my next visit. You do NOT get that kind of service just anywhere. I love these guys. If you're going to spend any time in Dallas, you really can't do all that much better than the W Victory.
UR107552247	My wife and I stayed at the W Hotel on our anniversary recently so we could walk to dinner at Kenichi, and go to a concert at House Of Blues. The service was an after thought for us when booking, but I have to say I have not experienced such excellent service from any company in a long time. Thomas, the general manager, saw to it that every special request I made was fulfilled EXACTLY as I had requested and even took it a step further. From check in to, to in-room service, and every experience in between it was perfect. The atmosphere is great, rooms are always immaculate and it was service with a smile all around. We stay at the Ritz on occasion, but I much prefer the attitude at the W - luxury all the way & hip.
UR105788061	My wife and I spent the weekend in Dallas recently for our anniversary. We stayed at the W at Victory Plaza. The hotel was of course wonderful, but the staff was what really made it shine. Meghan at the front desk was fantastic and added a few extra touches that made our stay memorable. The hotel also has a concierge shuttle that took us to our dinner reservations and picked us up right on time.
UR104051081	We booked several rooms for a group of girlfriends for a night on the town in Dallas and this hotel and its wonderful staff fit the bill perfectly! When you step in the hotel you notice the modern lobby decor and the friendly staff. The staff was very informational about where to go and what to do. The skillful bartender and excellent breakfast were among the highlights. The rooms were comfortable with crisp cotton-covered duvets on comfy mattresses, and the bathrooms were nice and big, which provided enough room for six women to get ready. A favorite of course was the upscale bath products. Every girl loves Bliss products. Excellent location, just blocks from Mckinney. I can't say enough about the staff, who made sure that we had everything we needed. Just above and beyond in every way...
UR103522740	We wanted to have a girl's night out and chose to stay at The W. We couldn't have picked a better spot. We let them know that we had 6 girls and they accomodated us with connecting rooms. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Everyone who worked at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful. We enjoyed fun drinks downstairs at the bar and had a fabulous breakfast at Craft the next morning. The pool area on the 16th floor was fabulous, and we spent some quality time there. In addition the hotel offered complimentary car service to the spots we were going to that evening. All around a great stay!
UR101623293	I am a platinum member, and was upgrade to the "wonderful suite" at this hotel. Staff was very, very friendly and always willing to help out. Concierge recommended a great sushi restaurant right around the block from the hotel (can't remember the name). Utilized the Acura courtesy car service one night to eat in Uptown. Workout room on the 16th floor is very nice (infinity pool looked nice as well, but did not go in it). Above this hotel in the same building are residences. No starbucks near the hotel (I am a starbucks addict!). The hotel had coffee in the bar each morning (along with some pastry type items). You could also go in the full service restaurant, but I never did on this trip. Hotel is right across the street from American Airlines arena. We went to a Mavericks basketball game on Sunday night, and there was a fun pre-party band out in the arena courtyard area before the game. You could actually watch the band from the seats outside the bar at the W. The Ghost Bar was not open any of the nights we were at the hotel (Sun-Wed). This bar is located above the residences I think on the 26th floor.
UR96468264	Upon making the reservation I requested the in-room refrigerator be emptied of hotel stuff. Also that a small fridge ($10 day) be provided. Asked and was assured both would be taken care of before we checked in. Neither was. I had to call a request rental fridge and first one they delivered was broken. The bedspread had an odd yellow stain on it. The advertised 42" TV in fantastic suite was 32". For $400 a night, it ought to come with at least 42". Looked cheap. The office phone was found laying behind the desk on floor, as was coaster for the two glassed they just set down on bare desk. No where on web site or when making reservations are you informed of $24 overnight parking charge. the deeo tub was nice, as was rain shower. I thought room was dark, cold and pretty devoid of artwork. chaise in living room area looked good, but not that comfortable.
UR94519395	The W is really nice. The staff were great. I had a massage at Bliss and it was fantastic and worth every penny. There is a very well equipped work out room that I used both days. The concierge provided excellent advise on where to eat dinner both nights and called and made my reservation too. I stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was really nice. However, (and this is a small complaint) I think that for the price of a suite the flat screen TV should be at least a 46 inch. There is plenty of wall space, but for some reason the TV was only a 32. Weird. Maybe the big one broke and this was a temp replacement? Also, it seems like the rooms need to be updated soon.. They are not exactly out of date, but they seem to be on the edge of it decor wise. Since this is a Starwood property I am sure they will do something soon which would only make this hotel nicer. Room service runs all night which is nice if you want a burger at 4am. (we did-it was great too) Just off the lobby is a decent bar and the Craft restaurant (owned by Tom Colicchio of Top Chef fame) and they offer a car service that will drop you off in and around the downtown area.
UR94277888	I had a superb stay at the W last Thursday 1/20/2011. So good it was that it prompts feedback. I typically blow right through these customer service emails but when service surpasses mediocre standards I feel I must oblige. Valet, concierge and front desk staff were very welcoming and my room was exceptionally cozy. Many, many thanks to Angelina the front desk staff (I think) who ensured everything I requested was catered to and more. Her politeness and genuine outreach to address all my concerns deserves hearty commendation. Thanks to Angelina and all your entire staff and I look forward to another stay soon.
UR92874598	I would like to thank Mike and the staff for a wonderful stay at the W. Every staff member went above and beyond to accomidate me and my guests. Thank you.
UR91055676	Decor was extremely Modern. They have 2 of the best quality restaurants in Dallas located downstairs. It's fine for people who are older as long as you're young at heart. The rooms are a little small but you're paying for the awesome atmosphere. You can rent movies that are still in theater. Just go check it out
UR90478512	4th or 5th stay at this property. Good location...just down the street from the JFK Memorial, cool shops and across the street from American Airlines arena. Rooms are contemporary and spacious and staff goes out of the way to accommodate. Never had a single issue at this property.
UR90122669	Outstanding customer service as they went out of their way to please all our wishes! We've stayed at nearly every Uptown Dallas hotel, and we've finally found paradise. We'll be back!
UR90058354	I stayed here because of proximity to a friend I visited, but I was very lucky as it exceeded my expectations. The people were very friendly & helpful, and the room was great. Overall, my experience was very positive & I can recommend if you are looking for a place to stay in Dallas, the W is great. It is located right across the street from the American Airlines arena, which was great for me as I went to the Dallas Mavericks game.
UR86628663	While I heard the W Hotel chain was very noteworthy prior to this trip, I will never stay in one again. The hotel itself, at least here in Dallas, is very chic and retro if you're into that sort of thing. The first thing that came to my mind after the first night of stay was that the rooms are not very user friendly and I will definitely NOT stay here again for the following reasons: the hotel information packet is concealed against the lamp making it difficult to find--I had to call the concierge to locate it and she said that guests call all the time inquiring the same; hot water during the day lasted about 5min for one of my friends; my bed sheet had dried blood under the pillow case; when I checked into my room there were two leftover wine glasses outside my door indicating room/maid service never came; maid service did come to my friend's room and they left the door open; and there is no bathroom on the gym floor which, if you workout, is a must for morning workouts if you know what I mean. All in all, a great hotel--NOT!
UR86451482	If you are expecting a "W" experience, this is not going to meet your expectations. The only compliment that I will give is regarding the efficient and friendly valet service. The hallways, rooms, etc. are very dark and gloomy. The rooms are very small and the furniture is worn and mediocre at best. I won't even discuss the bathrooms since I am in total agreement with other posters. We ordered room service in the morning and waited over an hour for coffee ($15). Supposedly they delivered to the wrong room. Anyway, we would not ever return here. Save a couple hundred dollars and stay at the Sheraton Suites on the other side of the highway.
UR86264977	Overall, the hotel was average to us. The room was very dark and cold feeling. I read the reviews about the bathroom and the curtain and thank goodness wasn't too surprised. When you step out from behind the shower curtain, you are there for anyone coming in the door to see...and there is a curtain between the bathroom area and the rest of the room so a little awkward. When we arrived there was a huge white stain on one of the comforters in a questionable spot. The staff said it was bleach but did change the entire bed for us. Yay! We felt old (35 and 33) and very un-hip. Great for younger, hipper people as many downtown hotels are. Breakfast was spendy and only available by room service or a so-so spread of muffins you paid for downstairs. No vending machines. Pillows and beds were very comfy. Room services was super speedy and very nice. We stayed on a Thursday non-event night so no idea about Ghostbar or other noises in hotel that others spoke of. Would recommend to younger, hipper friends.
UR85805022	We made a big mistake by staying at the hotel. We didn't appreciate what market they were playing to. Evidently it is the market for young, relatively inaffluent fans of loud, annoying technopop music, which played relentlessly in all public spaces. It was assaultive. And the air conditoning in our very tight "mega" room was noisy and obnoxious. I cannot imagine what a non-mega room is like, but we had to take turns getting dressed in front of the closet/bathroom area. In essence, our conclusion is that it is a new-ish hotel that tries to cover cheap construction with cheap fashion. Sorry-- but this is not a W property. It is far less. If you are over 30 or want to act like you are, don't stay here.
UR85382964	We stayed at W Dallas during the month of August. Knowing how hot Dallas can be this time of the year, we opted for a hotel with pool. Well, the pool was closed for a party and the hotel did not tell us in advance about it although we asked when the reservation was made. The front desk people did not want to be bothered with our luggage upon arrival either. We felt like we were rather a big inconvenience. We thought that maybe that was our bad luck . The following day, we encountered the same "we are too good for you" attitude when asked about concierge and room service. They seem to care more about the partying crowd than for the individual guests. Long wait for any (bad) service, and no apologies. Finally, when we checked out and asked about our stay, the front desk employee seemed little moved or concerned about our experience. We stayed at other boutique hotels that don't have this attitude. The location is great (right by I-35 and close to major highway intersections) and the restaurant (Craft) is great. But the rooms are small and not very clean. Be also aware that this is a party hotel, thus not best choice for people over a certain age or families with kids.
UR84917366	I stayed at the W Dallas Victory for 5 nights the week of October 10th. I have stayed at other W Hotels in the past and had extremely high expectations for this stay based on experience. When we got to our room, we were actually shocked at how much smaller it was than other W Hotels. Someone in the elevator actually mentioned it to us on our way up and said that this hotels rooms were a joke compared to other W Hotels - unless you book a room on a higher floor. Upon walking into our room, we immediately noticed a strong odor of urine in the room. We complained twice before we were moved (the first time, they sent someone up to spray a fragrance in the room to cover up the odor). The second room we were in had a malfunctioning lock. I found this out after leaving the room to get coffee the 2nd morning and I forgot my room key. My wife was in the shower, so I decided to try turning the door handle. To my utter shock and horror - it opened. I tried several times to get it to function properly and found that it did not work at all. Fortunately, we use the deadbolt and other locking mechanism when in the room through the night (as should everybody else). Telling the front desk about this issue resolved this problem without any issues. Another day, we were gone in the morning, and planned on coming back at around 3:30 or 4:00. We told the front desk so we could make sure our room was attended to while we were gone. Unfortunately, when we returned, our room was as we had left it in the morning. We called the front desk and told them to send up towels, as we would need to shower before leaving again. Over an hour went by without any towels. I called again and finally after 25 minutes got a knock on my door. It was the housekeeper there to clean the room. She knew absolutely NOTHING about the towels. We also had issues with the wall outlets during our stay. We could not get our cell phones, laptops, etc. to charge. We unplugged the alarm clock and still had no luck - waking up in the morning with dead electronics. We told the front desk about this problem the first morning and they said they would send someone up to check it out. The next morning, we complained again. We were told by the person at the desk that we were supposed to have the "master" wall switch turned on for the outlets to work. She said that someone should have let us know this when we checked in. Nobody did. Thinking we were missing the master switch on the wall, we turned on all switches the next night, sleeping with lights on and still woke up the last morning with dead batteries. Telling the front desk only got us an apology and offer to use the outlets in the bar. I've had some poor experiences at other hotels in the past and when I raised the issue, I was compensated with more than just an apology - a free night, a spa treatment, etc. This hotel would only offer a half hearted apology. Due to my experience, I emailed the hotel manager with pretty much the same as above. It took 5 days with no response before I emailed the corporate email address. Finally, on the 5th day, I finally got a response from the hotel manager's assistant. The response was nice and was filled with apologies. In the end, I was offered with an "added apology from the hotel" with 3,000 SPG points. In the meantime, I received a response from Starwood Hotels customer service and was given this response: "I have reviewed your file very carefully, and do believe the compensation offered is fair. The Starpoints could be used towards a free night stay in most participating hotels worldwide (Please note, the number of Starpoints required for a free night differs depending on the hotel category). I understand this may not be what you were hoping for, but I assure you that this decision was based on facts and careful research. In accordance with our practice, your concerns have been addressed with the hotel General Manager. The file has been closed. " I was not going to let this experience turn me off completely from W Hotels, but the email I got from Starwood changed my mind of that. In all, I do think this is a nice hotel - I just had a lousy experience topped off with lousy customer service.
UR84582118	I've stayed at this W several times and each trip there were some issues, but as it is very close to the Dallas Market Center we kept booking there. This trip will be the last. We returned at 4:30 from the market, and the room hadn't been cleaned. We called the front desk, and were informed that they were going "green" and you had to request to have the room made up...we were not informed of this at check in nor was there a card in the room regarding this policy. They did send up someone with fresh towels at our request. Additionally, the mini bar was never replenished but the ice bucket had mysteriously dissapeared, so someone had been in our room. After yet another call, someone arrived with an ice bucket. We asked to speak to the manager on duty. He did say it was their policy to not clean the roomsexcept by request because they were going "green". (This was puzzling, because the room was cleaned after the first night stay with no request) Other problems: After we arrived, I tried to access their wifi service , as I had on previous stays. I had to call the front desk (twice) for assistance. The third call they transferred me to Tech Support. The support agent had me change several settings in my computer, (about 15 minutes) he said he could "see" my computer but needed me to change some more settings and be on hold for awhile. I started to get a bad feeling about the whole thing, then opted not to continue, and went without my computer for the rest of the stay. I was stunned to see a $2 outgoing charge for the call on our bill. Obtaining a hot shower or bath was problematic, as the water in the tub/shower took almost 10 minutes to get warm and a then longer for hot. (hmm...not so green...) The movie we wanted to watch wouldn't load, and took three calls to the front desk and a visit from maintenence. My companion ordered a bottle of wine with room service, only a glass was sent. When she asked about it, she said that she was only charged for the glass. When she checked the bill, she had been charged for the whole bottle ($48) The bellmen, room service servers and valets were great...friendly and efficient. However, we found the front desk staff to be somewhat indifferent to our problems.
UR80185580	If you are over 25 you may want to stay somewhere else. We were there to celebrate a 40th birthday and were carded and key checked everytime we needed to go up the elevator. No alcohol was allowed to be taken up to the rooms so forget trying to bring up a few bottles of wine! I can understand the need for all of the restrictions when you are dealing with a younger clientele...and there were young people everywhere....which is my point...if you are older, looking for a nice evening, superior service and relaxation do not go to the W!
UR78652640	This is my 1st stay at a W (I generally don't splurge on hotels, & didn't this time either...my girlfriend used her rewards points). Let's just say, I don't have $300/night to burn on a room...but if I did...I would prolly choose to burn it here. Ideal place for the sassy singles. Rooms were extremely comfortable, great views of the city, and excellent location for accessing nightlife. On Saturday night, we went to the Ghostbar on the 33rd floor...great music and we didn't spend a dime on alcohol since I would easily say the ratio of men to women had to be 4:1. The crowd there wasn't THAT spectacular, but sufficed. A couple of genuine creepy looking guys and eccentric weirdos that made us feel uncomfortable (I know this used to be quite the hotspot 2 years ago, cannot say the same now). Back to the room: the mini bar prices in-room were excessive, even by luxury standards. $13 for coffee? Are you crazy...but since we saw no starbucks within quick walking distance...boo. The pool on the 16th floor is insane...but if you are trying to sunbathe...eh, not so much! We went out there around 1:30 and had to get in the cold water and cross to the back corner of the pool to find some sun. This place is DEFINITELY geared to the singles, once again (which we were, but one friend had her kids). DO NOT take the kiddos to the pool after 3 pm on a weekend. Let me explain...this place is aimed to the partying late 20 & early 30 somethings....the crowd we observed at 6 pm much different than the noon crowd. Noon crowd is still on the safe side....but the later and later it gets....here comes the crowd that probably got home at 6 am, rather than 230am. This crowd also contains ppl that are on who knows what exotic designer cocktail drugs b/c we saw a couple having sex in the pool....yup! Oh, did I mention there were kids in the pool at the time & plenty of other ppl. Geez, this isn't Rehab Las Vegas! Go to your room! The pool isn't THAT big, so it is not like they were hiding. And if they weren't having sex, then hunny, they sure did a good job of fooling the rest of us. Anyways, I'll have to say there's another downside to this hotel...the location/neighborhood is blah! We chose to walk to the nearby dining options and it felt like we were walking in a ghosttown....I was waiting for a tumbleweed to flutter by....On a 2.5 block walk to the House of Blues and Hooters around 5 pm....we saw 0 other ppl walking around. what gives?!?!!? I'm from Austin...people are ALWAYS walking around outside...this is just weird to see so much desolation/abandonment. I couldn't even tell if House of Blues was open b/c there wasn't anyone parked in the lot...we chose Hooters, which had ppl, but still...so desolate! I imagine when the Mavs are playing across the street at the American Airlines center, that the place is alive, but at the moment....dead! Word from some locals is that this Victory Park area is losing money fast and that the investors are quickly selling their shares...shame, b/c it was a cool idea. Meanwhile, the W, as a hotel, is nice. Oh, and yes, they do not have a separate shower area, so you have to draw the curtains....just weird. BUT, they have plenty of mirrors, but lighting not great. And definitely not enough plugs...when will hotels learn that with all technology requiring charging....laptops, phones, etc....we need more outlets!!!! OH...parking situation sucks....$24 to valet? really? This is Dallas, not Miami, NYC, or LA. There is a garage across the street that I got lucky and only paid $5 to park from Saturday to Monday...but I snuck in during nightclub parking hours and then did NOT move my car again til Monday checkout time....cabbed it to the clubs downtown b/c they were less than a $10 ride. OHHHHH...and the cabs charge $2 more per person, so keep that in mind....wtf? I guess I am spoiled in Austin where you can put 4 ppl in a cab and if it only costs $5 to get where you are going, then that's it...no "Per person" addtl fee.
UR76698298	I stayed here for the first time earlier this week with my Mom for a Women of Faith conference at the American Airlines Center across the street from the hotel. The convenient location is the only thing I really enjoyed during our stay. We had no idea until we got to the room that there is barely any privacy in the bathroom. The tub/shower is not separated by a door. So you have to pull a curtain all the way across the room to separate the bath from the bedroom. Also, the only wall outlet in the bath area was very low on a wall between the tub and sink- not very safe with lots of water around. The first night we were there, I barely slept at all as I could not sleep under their very thick down comforter. This was the middle of August- too hot for down comforters. There were no other options for bedding in the room. The second day, I called and asked for a different blanket and that one was much better. Finally, three days after staying here, I noticed that I was charged the full amount on my credit card even though we asked the man at the front desk to put half on my mother's card and half on mine. Not sure why that was not done.
UR72923502	Pretty inexpensive. Rooms are nice, is overdone. Also, the shower isn't in a separate room, but you can draw a curtain that separates the bathroom from the bedroom. Since we were a large party, we just chose not to use it. The management kept getting things wrong and were generally an annoyance. We complained, they offered us a later checkout time and then the next day asked why we hadn't left yet. No communication. Also, not
UR71483036	My girlfriend and I stayed just one Saturday night at the W Dallas in Victory Park but were initially impressed by the hotel's smooth operations and friendly staff. After we left and realized we had forgotten some clothes in the closet of the room we were very impressed by how the hotel handled the situation. When I called the front desk and told them what happened I was immediately directed to a "Lost & Found" department. I spoke to Girard (sp?) who was very friendly and was told the W would FedEx our clothes back to us on their dollar! We received the clothes in four days and the items were fully intact with the garment bag zipped and folded nicely in a box. It definitely capped off a great stay and we'll be going back. Thank you W!
UR70607380	In Dallas for a Texas Ranger baseball game. Stayed at the W at the recommondation of my son. Staff was very attentive. Waitress and bartenders friendly and engaging. The pool on the 16th floor is a must see. The view was incredable both day and night. Food in the main dining room was good. Light fair in the main bar along with complimenary coffee in the A.M. Ghost bar on the 33rd floor for $15.00 (Cover charge, women free) is probably worth the view. Glass enclosed outdoor sitting area off the bar for smokers and viewing the city lights. Lots of music and plenty of people in both the 1st floor and Ghost bars at night. Room and beds were perfect. All in all a great place to stay to get a feel for downtown Dallas nightlife. P.S. The Orioles won.
UR68949519	I stay at the W Victory in Dallas once a month for the past 3 years and have been delighted by the service, quite rooms, cleaniness, design, and VALUE of this great hotel. I travel frequently around the US and UK and am a loyal Starwoods guest. The W Victory Dallas is by far, one of the finest W's and Starwood properties have have stayed in. I am very particular about the deisgn, cleaniness, even scent of a room and this W has all features very pleasing and cpomfortable, even the BLISS toiletries are GREAT! AND the CRAFT hotel restaurant is great FINE dining from NYC, a great Zagat highly recommedned restaurant, well deserved ratings. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND any Dallas visitor to stay at this fine hotel.
UR67311151	As a current fan of W Hotels, I was expecting to be wowed and I was.The room and the service was great except I noticed the outdoor bar area did not get turned and cleaned without asking.We even met a guy and his dog who live there.He was great! I dream of living at a W someday so I was thrilled.I saw Mark Cuban in the lobby restaurant,looking hot! Sitting at the outside bar,we could see the jumbo TV across the street for the away Mavericks game.Went to Ghost Bar every night.The bartenders there were great.There was a b eautiful pool ,too freezing to use.They could make a lot of money up there if they just heated the pool. Also, I am addicted to Craft the yummy restaurant in the lobby.
UR66914177	So I just got home from an AWESOME weekend with some friends in Dallas. We were in town from Friday - Sunday and stayed at the W Hotel. Loved every freakin' minute of it...not just the hotel - but Dallas is pretty slick. I'd never been, but I'll for sure go back. i always try to try out the W Hotels in different cities and Dallas - by far - has become my new favorite. From the get go, I was...well..."wowed" as the say it. I was greeted at the front desk by my name (how they knew it, I'll never know). Went up to my room that was pre-cooled, great big king size bed, clean and smelled like all the rest of the W's I've stayed in. I guess its a consistency thing...I like it. Over the weekend, me and the gang hung out at the pool (which is pretty much covered, so if you're looking for sun - not the place to go). There's a bar at the pool and the place was PACKED! We met some really awesome guests that were there for the weekend - there was a pregnant chick - which was weird - she left pretty quickly haha. Dinner at the restaurant was good. Its pretty chill in there - Kraft or Craft...the waiter mentioned something about Top Chef, not sure. Good food, killer wine, and the prices were not out of this world like I'd expected. Besides the ugly cowboy hats, the bar at the hotel is pretty neat too. It's got a sweet patio (kinda windy) but it was hella hot, so no complaints there. Anyway - W Dallas really showed up the other W's I've stayed at. Actually can't wait for the new one in NYC to open - its literally 8 blocks from where I live so - convenience? Heck yes! Kudos Dallas - you're not all cowboys...surprisingly. Yee haw!
UR60887994	I have to say I was always a bit skeptical of staying with any of the W Hotels. I always thought they'd be crawling with wannabe hipsters and wannabe "cool-kids". I was also afraid of not getting a good nights sleep, thinking the hotel would be packed full of partiers late at night. Boy, was I wrong. The first time I stayed at the W was in August of 2009 with two of my girlfriends. From the moment we drove up, we were greated pleasantly by the valet staff and greeted kindly at check-in. They made us sign some kind of "sweet dreams" note that basically promised we wouldn't throw any parties that would disturb other guests, which was totally fine with us because we aren't those kind of people. We made it up to GhostBar one night, and that was...well...an interesting crowd. Not very "high-end". Just a lot of wannabes it felt like. In April of 2010, my boyfriend and I stayed at the W just for one night and had a great experience. Valet and the front desk were always extremely courteous and kind to us. The rooms are very cool and modern, not a whole lot of decoration. The beds are wonderful and so comfortable, I always slept like a baby. The shower was really nice as well. We never really had much of a view of anything but the highway. But honestly, when I go to hotels in a big city, I could care less to be looking out the window. The pool would probably be my biggest complaint. It's a completely covered area so you get zero sun. There are a few parts on the far edge of the pool, meaning you'd have to swim to get to it, that has a little bit of sun and those spots I'm sure are hard to get unless you get out there early. All-in-all, both of my experiences at the W were wonderful and I definitely will stay again!
UR60027164	We arrived on Saturday afternoon and checked in - easy!! After a drink in the Living Room bar, we headed upstairs. I follow the hotel on Twitter and was suprised when an amenity was delivered to the room! The Whatever. Whenever button came in handy for us. The house car, a great Acura SUV, took us to a location within a 5 mile radius (it runs until 11 pm). We tipped the driver and that was it - much cheaper than a cab ride and safer than driving ourselves! Once we returned to the hotel, we ordered room service and even though the IRD associate said it would be 45 minutes, the food arrived in 10 minutes flat! They even included complimentary water for us. It was a great weekend and the hotel really went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful stay. The only issue was with the patio area of the bar - the seat cushions were torn, burned, and stained. The floor was covered with burn marks and scuffs. We were told that the area is about to be remodeled and I'm sure the All-Star game took it's toll on the hotel. It must be difficult to keep up these areas!
UR59977632	W Victory Park was built to be the prime hotel in the victory park neighborhood. It is right next door to the american airlines center. Victory park is basically the name for this area and it looks like an attempt was made to make it a sort of upscale disctrict near downtown Dallas. The problem is that just because you have expensive hotels, expensive office buildings, and a state of the art arena does not mean it actually becomes a cool/hip/trendy place. Since Victory Park has not yet achieved this goal the W actually feels a bit out of place here. You can walk to the Hard Rock Cafe or Hooters but that is really it- if you arent going to a game the location stinks. The hotel itself is your typical W with a flew more flaws. For one the walls here are really thin. I have stayed at other W's on weekends and not been woken up by people talking in the hallways and slamming doors before. Also their housekeeping was inconsistent. One day they forgot to give me bath towels. Another day they forgot to give me soap. On yet another day they threw out my unfinished cashews that I bought from their mini-bar. Oh yes and this is something else. This W's minibar was for many items double what they are in other hotels. 7 bucks for a soda which expired in october 2008??? yup. I should also mention the 'ghost bar' is supposde to be a pretty awesome spot. I did not make it there during my week at this hotel though.
UR59909600	I was visiting friends in Dallas and they mentioned that the W was a popular place to stay. I am glad I tried it, but would not go back. I had some really terrible service experiences at the hotel and some very good. However, the bad was really bad so it has tainted the rest of my stay. I had heard that the W is like a nightclub....and it is. So if you are looking for 'trendy' with nightclub mood lighting and music thumping in the background, this place is for you. However, be aware that on Friday and Saturday nights, things get a little wild - I was woken up for about an hour in the middle of the night by partiers yelling in the hallways (I think they had come from the nightclub in the hotel).
UR59714758	I stayed at the W because I had a meeting at the Love Field Conference center. I typically stay at the Westin Stonebriar in Frisco. What a disappointment! The service was fine. The check-in and attendants were friendly and helpful. It was the room quality that suffered. Poor lighting, a not so heavenly bed, lame shower, cramped quarters, fuzzy TV and the wrong paper at my door (I requested at the desk the Dallas Morning News and was given USA-Today) Lame! I can't believe this is a 5 Starwood property. This was, by far, the single worst Starwood property I have stayed at in the last three years. At the end of my stay, to be fair, I figured that the W was a brand that did not fit my image or needs. I typically hit the sack early and and up early for an AM run and want to be pampered at bit in the classic sense. By the way, the door service ( like a good firm handshake) says something about a place. They dropped the ball on half the time I entered the hotel---and it was not because they were too busy. Just too cool! Fine, you have have your splash, but I won't stay there again!
UR59044893	Great hotel. Outstanding service, and larger rooms than I have seen in the Ws I've stayed in. Comfortable beds, and easy access bathroom. Not really thrilled with the rain shower, but really no other negatives other than the high price still seems out of the range that you would expect with a property of this sort. Room service entrees are small, so order up, and room is pretty dark.
UR57469840	I decided to cash in my gift certificate at Bliss Spa Dallas and I'm extremely glad I did. The masseuse was awesome!!! The spa itself is also great. Even thought it lacks a jacuzzi as another reviewer mentioned, it has a sauna room and great steam showers. In regards to the actual hotel, while the desk attendants in the lobby were extremely helpful, the valet guys stole all the change from my car!!! I'm annoyed that I didn't see it until I came home or otherwise I wouldn't have given them a tip :/
UR55950908	The W Dallas Victory was a wonderful weekend getaway for my fiancee and my self. We plan on doing it every anniversary.
UR52608996	We stayed in the spectacular room The only thing that separates the bedroom and the bathroom is a pull curtain. Absolutely no privacy and no where to plug in curling irons. Rooms are small and the beds sagged to the miiddle. My daughter went to the ghostbar where she was rudely jumped on by the bartender for not tipping. A tip is suppose to be earned not given for no reason. A bag of chips from the inroom snacks is $7.00 for a 50 cent size bag. Also you have to pay extra for a coffee maker and have it sent to your room. The biggest problem is NO decent lighting. Also the plug in for the dryer was 6 inches from the bathtub.
UR52125424	Beautiful hotel and rooms but the show stopper is the pool deck. Located on the same floor as the Bliss Spa on one of the middle floors of the hotel, the pool deck is an amazing open-air place to relax with incredible views of the city, relaxing lounge furniture, bar and music.
UR51682441	The W Dallas is an amazing hotel with a great atmosphere and staff and a great bar. I will definitely stay there again!
UR51609244	My wife and I try to get away to a hotel once or twice a year. This time we picked the W hotel in Dallas, TX and it was awesome. We were unsure at first but got connected with one of the hotel staff that made sure our experience was special. We stayed in a WOW Terrace Suite overlooking Victory Park. The room was huge and the view was spectacular. I had coordinated a head of time to have some of my wife's favorite music and drinks in the room and it was all well prepared even for early check-in. The staff was very knowledgeable, courteous, and professional. Dinner at Craft was amazing. The food was excellent but the service was what set it apart. Great choice of hotel and dinner for a weekend away. Very thankful for the staff doing the extra things to make the night special.
UR47353337	In another review, I mentioned that the Aloft hotel oversold their hotel and were unable to book my parents a room at another downtown hotel and this was the night before the Texas-OU fooball game. This is the happy ending to that story that occurred at the W. I had a reservation at the W Hotel for four of us in the party because we were unable to get two rooms at the Aloft. After the Aloft was unable to find us another room, we got to the W around 1am and were welcomed by James at the front desk. I told him that I knew they were sold out, but that if anybody cancelled or didn't show up that night to please let us know because my parents were going to have to cram into our room on the floor because the Aloft gave away their room. He apologized profusely even though the W had done everything right and said that he would see what he could do. He then went to the back to check on something and came back to let us know that the manager said it would be ok for him to upgrade us to a suite so we would have more room for my parents. This must have been an emergency room they saved in case of problems at the hotel. The W did not have to do this, but they did and I cannot express how elated my entire family was with this. And this was no normal suite. It was an enormous suite, with a 6 person dining room and huge balcony overlooking the American Airlines Arena. On a sold out night before one of the biggest football games of the year, the W came through and I will never forget how well we were treated. My parents couldn't believe it either. They still live in a pretty small Texas town and they must have called everyone they knew the next day to tell them about the room and the view of downtown Dallas. The hotel staff even called the next morning to say they had rooms available if we still wanted to book one more for the second night and that we could use cash and points. So I booked another room for the second night for my parents to give us another bed. But the suite was excellent for that first night after we had all been travelling the whole day and it was so convenient for getting to the game the next day on the DART. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE AT THE W FOR MAKING THIS TRIP ONE THAT MY PARENTS WILL REMEMBER FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.
UR47197681	We'd never stayed at a W hotel before, but it exceeded our expectations. And there is a Bliss Spa associated with the W, an added bonus!
UR46537756	This was my third stay at the W Dallas Victory and it gets better every time. Even walking into the hotel is a sensory delight with its glass-and-steel design, party music, fruit-infused water (especially nice in the heat of summer) to greet you and good scents used in the lobby. The low-light hallways feel private and the rooms are sleek and modern, decorated in gray and black with extremely comfortable beds, love seats, bathrooms with slate tile and outfitted with "rain" showerheads. If you use valet parking, call ahead to avoid a wait at the door. Also, The Ghost Bar, upstairs, is one of Dallas' hotspots so weekends can get crowded, but the W staff will help you navigate. The staff is all about service - when they say 'whatever, whenever,' they mean it.
UR45590960	When my sister suggested staying at The W, I was a little less than thrilled. I assumed it would just be another over-priced, terrible service, run-of-the-mill hotel. I am happy to report that I was COMPLETELY WRONG!!! Everything we experienced during our stay was amazing! The hotel was gorgeous and our room was fantastic! We had 4 people in our room so I was concerned about being cramped but that wasn't an issue at all. Every single staff member that we dealt with was PHENOMENAL! We were treated with so much genuine care and respect while staying there. They were all so polite and fun! The other interesting thing we noticed while there was that all of the guests were so nice to each other and so much fun as well! It's obvious that The W has set a tone there that spreads to their guests! A few days after we checked out, I noticed a charge from the mini-bar on my bank statement. We had not used anything on the mini-bar so I called and spoke with the accounting department. They refunded the charge without any hassle! Now THAT is customer service! We don't live far but will definitely be considering The W again for a "mini-vacation" in the near future!!
UR43656613	we chose the W Hotel for the weekend of the UFC 103 which was located right across the street at the American Airline Center. We specifically chose this hotel so that we wouldnt have to deal with taxi's or parking and the Ghost Bar was the official UFC afterparty location. we spoke with 3 seperate employees (just to make sure) to ensure that we would get in due to the fact that we were a guest at the hotel. they proceeded to tell us that we would be able to get in through the hotel enterence located inside and that we could charge our cover charge (women free, men $15) to our room and would pay upon check out. we asked them many times if they were sure that this information wouldnt change due to the event. they assured us. needless to say they wouldnt let us or anyone for that matter use the hotel enterence. so we proceeded outside to get in line. WE NEVER GOT IN. the blonde headed bimbo who was holding the "list book" ingnored me on several accounts. finally when i got her attention she told me that it didnt matter if i was a hotel guest or NOT and that the price was $40 per person....male and females. it was waste of my time and my friends.....would never EVER go back.
UR43460913	The rooms are simple, which I like- less to get dirty. The rooms are always clean and have plenty of everything you need. Bliss Spa is a great getaway- I would recommend the body scrubs- completely relaxing. The pool is relaxing and has a great bar with it. Order lunch, drink a few and take a nap. We had breakfast and dinner at Craft downstairs. Breakfast was wonderful and dinner was Perfect!! My husband and I literally licked our plates- well, almost. The ricotta cheescake was the best I have ever had. I'm not very knowledgeable of wine, but we tried several and enjoyed them all. The ghostbar was WILD! We went up to have a few drinks and ended up having too much fun and too many drinks! The beds are very very comfortable!! When they say whatever whenever- they've never failed me. I have been going to the W for several years now and will continue to stay there while in Dallas area.
UR37764727	Me and my wife stayed at The W for a relaxing weekend. The hotel and the employees were outstanding. This was the best hotel experience that we have ever had. All the employees were friendly and helpful. Anything we needed the got. The hotel was very clean and modern looking. We loved the infinity pool. And the pool bartender, Rosa Leo, was excellent and very friendly. We also loved the Ghostbar in the hotel, the view is amazing. The only fault that we could find during our entire stay was that the room took a long time to cool down. Other than that we had an awesome weekend at The W!
UR36530365	This was hands down the worst hotel experience of my entire life! We have had better service and amenities at LaQuinta's! We arrived at the W at 4pm (an hour later than check-in), and we were told our room was not ready. The clerk gave us our room number so we could charge our beverages to the room and invited us to wait up at the pool deck for it to be cleaned. She took down my husbandsâ€™ cell phone number and promised to call when the room was available. On our way upstairs to the pool we decided to stop by the room to see if anyone was tending to it. We found ONE chambermaid working the entire floor, and at no hurried pace either. We could see our wait was going to be significant. Upon arriving at the pool deck we sought out the â€œchanging roomsâ€� mentioned to us by the clerk for putting on our swimming gear. We were appalled to find this so-called changing room was a Uni-sex, single stall restroom meant to be shared by all 100+ patrons of the pool area. Needless to say, it was absolutely disgusting! At the pool we started to get a clear picture of the typical character attracted to the W Hotel; frat daddies and sorority chicks. There wasnâ€™t a single place to find a seat anywhere on the deck. The pool area had a cool layout, but unfortunately my husband and I never got to experience it first hand b/c of the hoards of people we were contending with for space. PS- they charged us $5 for and 8 oz. cup of beer and $11 for a 8 oz. margarita. We waited at the pool for 2 hours and never received a call, so we finally headed back to the lobby on our own. We asked the clerk at the front desk, now a different young lady than before, if our room was ready yet, she looked up our name and told us it was. WE HAD NEVER RECEIVED THE PROMISED CALL! When we told her that her response was, â€œWell, I donâ€™t know why. We sent you a text message and I donâ€™t know why YOU didnâ€™t get it.â€� There was never any admission from her that a 2-hour wait, with no communication, was unacceptable! There was never even an apology! In her tone she even had the audacity to suggest it was our own fault the message hadnâ€™t been received. Incidentally, what kind of costumer service rep thought a â€œtext messageâ€� would be the best way to communicate with the customer? How impersonal! Then, on top of this, the girl proceeds to give us information for a completely different room number than what we received earlier. Waves of distrust for the Wâ€™s reservation software, containing our precious credit card information, came flooding to our minds. Whose room had we charged our drinks to and how easy would it be for someone else to do the same thing to us? Why had we even received an incorrect room number? Did we truly receive an incorrect room number, or did the clerk pull the olâ€™ switch-eroo because sadly the original room was still not available? All we do know for sure is that our first room was located at the very end of the hallway, where we could have enjoyed more privacy, and our new room was right, smack in the middle of the hallway where we had the luxury of hearing anything, and EVERYTHING that took place anywhere on our floor. The rooms at the W Hotel are a joke. You walk in and you are immediately in the bathroom. It feels like the dorms on a college campus. The hotel strives for a modern feel, but they used such cheap materials it ultimately feels contrived and desperate. It is evident that multiple corners were cut in the construction of this hotel. There is one outlet in the bathroom found tucked a foot from the floor in the narrow space between the sink and the shower. There is only one towel hook in the entire room. The closet space was obviously an afterthought; their own luggage holder couldnâ€™t even open the full span in the space within the closet. The lights in our particular room (#1421) were erroneously wired making it a guessing game each time you tried to turn off/on a light; sometimes one switch would work, but then it wouldnâ€™t so youâ€™d have to try another switch. The view was not at all â€œSpectacularâ€�; we faced a giant construction site. The walls were paper thin and our particular room had a conjoining door to another room which you could hear everything through. It was like having a roommate! Yeahï�Œ Because of the â€œqualityâ€� customer W Hotel apparently attracts, it was no surprise to us that at 2:15am we were rudely awaken by screaming drunk people streaming in from the bars. When sharing experiences with some fellow patrons the next morning we even learned about a couple of physical fights that took place in the hallway of the 8th floor between two different parties staying there. The valet service was literally the single enjoyable thing about this hotel. The guys truly had a heart for serving and seemed to enjoy their jobs. The wait was non-existent. They were very efficient. I guess the one thing W Hotelâ€™s management has done right is contracting out their valet parking. I hate to think we wasted $280 on such a pitiful experience. I read that W Hotelâ€™s in other cities have a much better reputation, but at this point I have such a terrible taste in my mouth because of W Hotel-Dallas, I doubt weâ€™d ever consider staying at another W anywhere. Corporate needs to conduct a major overhaul of management at this W or else this hotel is destined to fail.
UR34587883	We are discerning travelers who enjoy luxury, high end hotels. Having stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, we recognize our expectations can be somewhat skewed. However, the W name generally carries with it a solid reputation and, altough not exactly luxury, typically offers high quality accomodations. Starwood usually produces a quality product. We were attending a concert at American Airlines arena and chose the W Victory Plaza mainly for its location - it is across the street from the arena. The physical facility is new and the surrounding area is still developing. I guess the management decided to match the neighborhood and keep the hotel staff "new" as well. I don't think we encountered a singe hotel employee over the age of 24. Desk clerks, bellmen, valet, housekeepers, room service, attendants, conceirge - all were very young and very inexperienced. The best way to describe the staff is extremely immature. They had no grasp of customer service, were too busy consumed with impressing each other or making plans to "hook up", and generally present as a bunch of college kids who are using the hotel as their own country club. If management reads this, listen up: On the weekends, your hotel staff "invites" their friends to utilize the swimming pool and other facilities as their psudo country club. We're not kidding. Just stand out on the sidewalk and see how many kids are parking down the street and walking into your hotel - bathing suits on - to use your pool area. We know. We walked the block and saw the trafiic coming and going. We spoke with some of them, and some of your own staff. Your staff was more excited to welcome and greet their friends - who were not guests - than to welcome their actual guests. If you care, you need to get a handle on this quickly. In terms of the room, for a new building the room was very dissapointing. It looks like someone tried to create a luxury room in a standard room environment. Lowering the lighting and cramming in "hip" amenities does not make the room any more comfortable or luxurious. The design is terrible, the quality is poor, the mechanics are failing, it was not the cleanest, and worst of all the AC is completely inadequate. Our room NEVER got cold. Nada. Hot. That is not good for Dallas, Texas. The room reminded us of some of those "re-do's" where someone takes over an existing facility and tries to convert it to a more modern and luxurious location , but fails. What is puzzling is this is a new facilty. What happened? Way too many corners were cut. The Living Room (lobby bar) was fun after the concert and the room service was both prompt and, surprisingly, of very good quality. (I would bet the chef is experienced) However, we were shocked to be told there was no place to eat on the premises between 2:00 and 5:30 - not even a coffee shop or snack bar. That is unacceptable for a full service facility. Overall, we do not plan on returning to the W Victory Plaza and would not recommend it to anyone who typically enjoys staying a the Ritz, Rosewood Mansion, or other upscale locations. We also would not recommend this location to anyone treating themselves for a special occasion - you will be very dissapointed. As two professionals, we would absolutely not recommend this facility to any business travelers - this is NOT a business hotel. We would recommend this location to any college students or young adults looking for fun and a fraternity like environment - throughout the hotel. Otherwise, opt for the cab or driver to and from the show at the arena and avoid the dissapointment that is the W Victory Plaza. Shame on you Starwood. Shame on you.
UR33673870	VERY VERY dissapointed!!!!!!!! First all i reserved a suite and paid alot of money for it...i expected better service then what i got..i had the suite reserved in my name and a friends name...instead of having one suite with 2 names they gave us 2 suites with one name on each!! Therefore not only did they charge my card but hers as well!! Some how my card still got charged for both suites and hers for one....talked to 4 different ppl as they are stating to remove the charges...we will see?? They also told us that we could have early check in...um nooooo we didnt get to check in until 4pm. I was w 8 girls on a bacelorette party. I was in charge of everything. IT was extremley embarassing that we had to go to the pool for ever to wait on our room....we came from out of town. Not to mention calling to lobby for things you need and they say they will bring them right up...and never come. Also we found 2 big pizza boxes...with pizza still in the box that was shoved under our couch that was not from us!!!??? GRoss!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would not recommend this place unless you are walking in to pay with cash..rooms are nice service SUCKS!!
UR33098942	Went to Eric Clapton concert with girfriends. The W is right across the street from the American Airlines Center. Staff was great as well as the location. Although the AC didn't cool the room as well as we would have liked (temp was 102 in Dallas that day!), I would recommened the W if you are going to an event at the AAC or visiting the West End.
UR32369042	Well first off check in is at 3:00, we arrived at 5:30 and our room was not ready(we were told it was because they were full the night before and they were behind on house keeping ha ha) so we had to take a smoking room. The air conditioner was off when we got to our room and it was so hot and smelled like cig. smoke , Once in our room we realize the sliding door where the toilet was does not stay closed and the only privacy you get between the bathroom and the bedroom is a curtain.Bring your own cokes because there are no vending machines, you have a fridge full of drinks if you like paying $6 for a can drink. Also bring some plastic cups to drink from cause you only get 1 glass by the sink. If you look for the electric plug in the bathroom I will let you know look really really good it is on the wall by the sink close to the floor and painted the same color as the wall lol . We left to go to a concert and when we returned I felt like I was walking into a night club, there were so many people hanging around the lobby and it was very dark and glowing. We stayed on the 8th floor and the noise of the drunk and rowdy in the hallway lasted well into the night. In the morning the room was still hot and the air conditioner ran all night. The bed was so comfy and the staff was very nice. I would never stay here again.
UR31302481	Let me start by stating that I love the W chain. My wife and I went to Dallas for our anniversary and while at dinner decided that we wanted to stay in town. I called the W and booked us a room. I hadn't stayed in the on in Dallas yet, so was looking forward to the experience. The room was large and well appointed and very comfortable. The view wasn't much to look at - the only rooms with views were smoking rooms. Who still has smoking rooms anyway? We went down to the lobby bar for a drink and found the service there and value to be quite good. Someone suggested we should go to the Ghostbar. Big, big mistake. We got to the velvet ropes and were asked if we were on the list even though there was no one in front of us. No, we weren't but because we were hotel guests the cover was $15. The doorman was pretentious and rude. You'd think he was outside the hottest club on Southbeach or Hollywood. Once upstairs, it was a major bust. Oh, sure a great view. They didn't even stock the same premium vodka at bar that they had downstairs. This was on a Friday night and the "crowd" was thin and pretty lame. Drinks were expensive for a measured pour. Bar staff were arrogant. Bouncers were snobby and aloof. There were probably more of them walking around with their earpieces than there were actual patrons. Didn't take too long to decide to leave and then got treated with more rude behavior from the bouncers/door staff. Arrogance defined. Save your time and money and stay in the lobby bar.
UR30649727	We booked a night at W Dallas-Victory for an anniversary weekend, along with reservations at Craft (restaurant located at the W). There were two big problems. First, it took four trips to the front desk was before they were able to get the room keys (magnetic cards) to work. The person at the front desk took it as a personal affront, insisting that the "system says the keys work just fine." We were finally able to get him to reprogram the keys (he refused to do so until the fourth (!!) trip to the front desk. The second big problem was the noise in the hotel. Throughout the night, we could clearly hear people talking in other rooms, Additionally, there were people coming and going ALL night, talking, laughing, drinking in the hallway. We finally gave up at 4:00 a.m. and checked out of the hotel and headed home. Not surprisingly, there were group of boisterous people in the hallway, lobby and even hanging out by the front door, drinking. Not exactly what you would expect from this upscale chain. On the positive side, their beds are incredibly comfortable and they have an excellent fitness facility (our keys didn't work there, either) and a beautiful swimming pool. The room (we had a "spectacular view king") was adequate in size but not particularly large for a Dallas hotel. Oddly, there are no drawers or shelves for clothing and only four hangars in the closet. The wall safe did not work. The LDC television was fairly small (I've had bigger television in a Hampton Inn) but of good quality. The room was clean but the hallways / elevators lobbies were not. The view was good but hardly spectacular. Unless you are attending an event at American Airlines Center next door, there is very little to do in the area within walking distance. On the REALLY positive side, Craft Restaurant is a wonderful experience. Nothing about the meal could have been improved; excellent food, amazing service, good wine list. (We spent a bit over $200 for two people including a bottle of wine and gratuity...worth every penny.) Recommend this restaurant without hesitation; just stay somewhere else.
UR29093350	I was very disappointed in the W Victory Park. We first had trouble with the parking garage across the street but I was told by the W that they were not affiliated with them so I will try to base my review mainly on the hotel. I had 7 people total in my group for my bachelorette party. We are in our mid 20's to 30's and not too high maintenance. The main reason we stayed at the W was for Ghostbar. We checked in arould 5pm (check in is at 3pm). I was told over the phone when making the reservation that they would try to get us adjoining rooms. Upon check in I was told that was never a possibility bc of the 2 queen beds we were getting and the layout of the hotel. It would have been nice to have been made aware of that when making the reservation but oh well. Ok so we had seperate rooms on the same floor. I was a little disappointed but ok with that. BUT they didn't have our 2nd room available yet. Again, check in was at 3pm. So we all went upstairs and got in our 1st room. The rooms were just ok. The TV was nice but I wouldn't say they were elegant or above average for the price of the rooms. By 5:45 we still hadn't gotten a call that our 2nd room was ready so I had to call down and check on it myself. They did send someone up with a key for the 2nd room at that point--but I shouldn't have had to call and the room should have been ready in the first place when we checked in, in my opinion! Later that evening we were going to go to Ghostbar. I was told on the phone that we could check in for our table from inside the hotel. They did have an entrance inside the hotel but when we got there we were told we would have to use the OUTSIDE entrance bc we had table service. Again, miscommunication on the hotels part. So we had to physically leave the hotel, walk around the corner and then go up to Ghostbar. We did have a great time at Ghostbar and really enjoyed ourselves there---thank goodness bc that was the whole reason we were staying at the W. When we checked out of the W the next morning I put the room charges on my credit card. When I looked at my credit card statement a few days later I noticed extra charges on there. Yep, you guessed it, the W put $45 of movie charges on there that we DID NOT get. When I called and told them this they did handle the matter promptly and told me it would be taken off my credit card. I haven't checked it yet so I hope they do follow through on that part. Overall, I was really disappointed in their service and the first impression was definitely not a good one.
UR28794926	My wife and I stayed on Friday the 24th to celebrate getting married. Just a quick, one night stay. The hotel is located in a busy area, with lots of activities/shopping near by. The staff was very polite and prompt and all about 24 years old it seemed. It is a very VERY modern, somewhat snobby hotel. While I can't say anything negative about the place, I must INSIST that you only stay here under the right circumstances. If you are over 35 years old and plan on being asleep by 10PM, do not stay here. If you are traveling with children, under 21..... do not stay here. If you do not like modern style rooms, do not stay here. Our stay was enjoyable. We chose not to try and venture up to the ghost bar nor did we eat in the restaurants. The room service menu looked pricey, but no surprise there. And the valet service was way over priced at 26 dollars. The garage is right next door, and over night parking is only 10 dollars. With the first 2 hours being free. So you can check in, park, and leave to go somewhere without having to pay parking or valet. Like I said, we didn't have a bad experience. But not everyone will enjoy this hotel.
UR24403993	This hotel is very modern and posh. I stayed there with 13 other girls for a Bachelorette party on a Friday. The area is abuzz on weekends and there are lots of beautiful people hanging around the lobby, bar, and waiting in line to get into Ghostbar. The hotel is right next to the AA center and there was a Stars game going on so the area was VERY busy and crowded. Traffic was not the greatest. Overnight valet parking was $24. Service was great but got the feeling that if we weren't cute young girls we would have been ignored. Although none of the staff yelled at us, I was told several times by my friends that when they booked the room they were reminded over and over again to keep the noise down. So, if you are going there to party in the room, think of going somewhere else. Overall, room was nice and clean. Staff was very helpful and mean it when they say "Whatever, whenever". We needed a limo ASAP and they called and booked it and had it there in 30 minutes. I would stay here again with the girls.
UR23200240	A spa that charges what the Bliss Spa at the "W" Hotel charges should have a Spa on the premises. The actual massage treatment was wonderful. The facility is terrible. #1 - There is no spa (jacuzzi, hot tub, whirlpool) anywhere on the premises. I have never been to a high-end spa that did not have both a spa and a cold plunge. Bliss in Dallas has neither. #2 - They will tell you they have a "Steam Room." Well - not exactly. There is one single shower in the mens small locker room. In that shower there is a steam outlet which is basically worthless. If you turned it on today, it might generate enough steam to be useful in about 24 hours. It is not a "Steam Room" like one would expect in a high-end spa. #3 - The lounge area, or waiting area where you wait before your massage treatment does not contain a single lounge chair. You are sitting there straight up in chairs facing 12 foot glass windows overlooking West Dallas. Sounds really cool, but when you are trying to get relaxed before a massage it is the last place you want to be - especially after you have just found out they don't even have a spa to soak in! OH yeah - and if you are bored, you can read one of the magazines in the HEAVY plastic holders they use to protect them. At $150 for a massage, one would think they could afford to replace the magazines and lose the Doctor's office protectors!! In addition, the "fresh apples" in the lounge area had to be at least a week or two old. They were mushy and inedible. Nobody paid any attention to what you needed or did not need. No nice soft fuzzy robes or lavender scented neck wraps were in sight. (P.S. - go to the Ritz or Crescent Court for these treats!!) #4 - The music --- Someone needs to tell the W Management that blues music is NOT spa music. They play the same music everywhere - even in the massage treatment room. You are on the massage table attempting to relax while this female voice is belting out a blues tune!! NOT RELAXING at all. I asked them to just turn it off. Eclectic is one thing - relaxing it is NOT!! #5 - The actual massage treatment was excellent. The therapist was very professional and did a fantastic job! I am a licensed massage therapist and I know what constitutes a great massage. Renee did mine and she was excellent!! If you go to the Bliss Spa, in Dallas -- just be ready. The facilities are just worthless. However, the massage is very very good.
UR22852251	My husband and I were both running in the White Rock Lake Marathon/Half-Marathon and chose this hotel because it was located (literally) at the start/finish line. I agree with some of the other reviews - if you are not one of the 'beutiful people' (read, under 30, female, monied), don't expect to be treated well, just tolerated. Most of the staff seemed to be annoyed they had to lower themselves to speak to me because, you know, they have to let 'anyone' stay there. Asking for a late (1:00 p.m.)checkout....you would have thought I was asking for a free night. Our reserved, pre-paid, room wasn't ready until 2 hours after we got there (and we checked in at 3:30 p.m.). If they did not want to make money off the runners participating in the event, they should not have advertised on the marathon's homepage. It is 'hip' and 'stylish' and may be 'the place' to stay but I found it to be cold (both in temperature and personality), dark and loud. If ultra modern is your style, this is the place for you. I prefer something a little more inviting.
UR22521608	Just like most W locations I certainly was not let down. However this place went the extra mile to make me feel at home. Right from the good looking valet attendants to Precious at the front desk I knew right away I made the right choice for this trip. Because of my status I was upgraded to one of their best suites, which had an awesome view of the Dallas skyline. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great time while in town.
UR20279850	The service at the W Dallas is over the top in rhetoric, and short in substance. The clean, smooth rooms are overshadowed by the staff that overpromise delivery of items / room service, and take forever. When you call down to front desk, they ask how they can fulfill your wish. I want to stay in a hotel, not Alladin's Lamp. I strongly urge the W to tone down the Studio 54 image they are trying to portray. It takes away from the experience and smacks of insincerity.
UR19944529	the W dallas was a fun time and the staff go out of their way to make sure your requests are fulfilled. The rooms are very modern looking with awesome plasma TVs! My only warning is if your planning on having a party in the room you can count on the staff breaking it up before it even starts! Other than that the Pool was a blast and the Living Room had a good DJ on saturday night... the front desk said they have one play every weekend. If you are looking for something different (upscale but with out the stuffiness of the ritz or mansion) this is a place to check out!
UR19318083	Not on par with other top notch hotels when it come to service and attention to details. Dinner at Craft exceeded expectation but the rest of the hotel staff was more like a Motel 6 staff. I have stayed at the Crescent, Fairmont, Hyatt and Mansion on Turtle Creek recently and they all exceeded my expectations.
UR19265493	I live in Fort Worth and stayed at the W for a friends birthday weekend we stayed in a corner suite and two other rooms our suite was gorgeous with a huge balcony nice over sized comfortable chairs and a nice fun view of the american airlines center. I only have two minor complaints, one being that ALL of the staff that i had encounters with were all very young and flirtatious, I'm 19 and very outgoing but they were a little over the top. And the second complaint would be that valet for some reason wouldn't let our limo pick us up from the front entrance we had to be picked up from the back entrance. Other than that the rooms were very clean, spacious, pretty much sound proof walls, and chic. The room service was a little slow but food was great and they got us everything we needed.
UR18946852	My husband and I just stayed at the W in Dallas for our 10 year anniversary. We live in the area and wanted a nice hotel to "get away" for a night. I was not impressed with the hotel at all. I found it stuffy, dark, and although I like contemporary designs, it was way out there. Our hotel keys would never work for the room and the elevator. We've stayed at the Mansion, Crescent and other local hotels for evening kid free nights and they were much better! Luckily, I used starwood points so I wasn't too upset since all I had to pay for was the $24 parking which is insane! If your coming to DFW, find another hotel.
UR18262440	I came here for business and so did not have the opportunity to make use of the leisure/spa facilities. I had a room on about 8th floor (I think) with a private patio area - I liked that aspect a lot. I couldn't work the patio doors to lock them (!) and a guy was up within 5 mins to help me out - very friendly and he dashed away not even expecting a tip! I think that this would be a great hotel for a girls/ladies weekend. Fun bar, great spa and cool rooms. Check-in staff was a little on the 'cold' side but the hotel evokes a cool ambience, definitely aimed at 'the beautiful people'. Open bathroom design was fine for me (shower on view from the bedroom) but the toilet area is behind closed doors. The complimentary shower goodies are from 'Bliss' range, which made a nice change. This hotel has its own Bliss shop where you can purchase products.
UR18177751	My family consists of 2 adults and 2 teenagers. We live in Plano and were planning to have an in-town vacation at the W hotel because we had heard that it was fabulous and chic. I booked a room for 3 nights at an outrageous rate ($300 per night). I asked the woman booking our reservations if there was any way to get a discounted rate. She told me in a rather bored voice that she couldn't get it any lower, and that I should be grateful to get a room because they were almost completely booked up for the weekend. I argued with her that I had been in the hotel not 5 hours before to check it out, and had had the front desk clerk tell me that they were less than half full. The woman didn't have a reply to that, and against my better judgement, I booked our room. When we checked in, the concierge was too busy flirting with girls going into the Ghostbar to notice us. After threatening to get the manager, my husband finally got us checked in. The room was on the 6th floor, and looked out at the unsightly buliding rooftops. To make things worse, our room was not clean. The beds were unmade, towels missing, no soap, a huge stain on the floor, and a phone that didn't work. Till now I was not aware that so many things could be wrong with one room, but I know better now! We all had to hull our luggage back downstairs to try to get a new room. I had to talk to the same stupid, young employee that wasn't doing his job earlier. His lazy attitude and unhelpfulness finally made me just throw my hands up in the air and leave. He reminded me as I was leaving that we would be charged for the room and cancellation. I told him that he could take the bill and shove it where the sun dosen't shine. I guess what the people who recommended the hotel to us meant to say was that it was fabulous for twenty-somethings and chic only if you lived in a pigsty. The Ghostbar is the only attraction that this hotel has. Therefore, it is not at all friendly to anyone not there to party and then crash for the night. I will most certainly not be going back again, and I will warn every single person I meet not to go there.
UR17132893	We decided to stay at the W to give it a try and we stayed in the cool corner room. We had a great view of Victory Park and downtown and loved the room for the most part. I wouldn't recommend going higher than the 5th floor because you will just see the ugly tops of buildings (kind of unattractrive) so the lower the floor, the better, to get a good view of Victory Park. Some problems with our room: big stains on the couches, 3 inch tear in the middle of the sheets (we can be picky at the price we paid) and we were hot at night and the thermostat read 65 degrees and it definitely wasn't that temperature in the room. Your room may have a 42" flat screen TV, but nothing to be excited about because there's no HD programming to support it. The picture on it was horrible. Don't plan on going to the pool and enjoying yourself unless you go early to find 1 of 4 chairs that are outside. There was no where to lay out due to lack of seating!!!!!!! We were so disappointed!!! The pool was not that great!!!!! The staff definitely could have been a lot friendlier. They don't make you feel welcome & don't expect to get the hospitality that you pay for. FYI Overnight parking is expensive & it shows up on your bill without notice of how much it will be.
UR16861891	My 84 year-old dad picked me up at DFW and on a whim I asked if he would mind hanging out with me at one of the newer hotels downtown. I knew one of them had a terrific infinity pool, so stopped by the W Hotel, and that was the one. SO decided to go with whatever they had as far as a suite went, so they gave us a WOW suite on the 14th floor (1401), and it was terrific and terribly expensive ($629) for me. The receptionist gave us complimentary breakfast for 2 since we were having a boys' night out. Dad thought it was silly and fun (though I didn't devulge the cost; told him my boss had given me a bonus, haha). The room was all odd angles, but really bright with floor to ceiling windows and great views of DT Big D and the freeway and industrial area (you have to be from Dallas to even begin to think this is pretty). It was fun just looking at the skyline which seems ever changing with all the building going on in this area. The pool was wonderful, and good stiff drinks at the bar. VERY WINDY, but OK with me. Almost blew my old dad over. Had very good hamburgers in the room and a bottle of red wine for about $60, but breakfast was terrific: eggs benedict and french toast for absolutely free (was about $50 on the menu). Way too much money, but the room was so weird it was cool. Separate bedroom with chase lounge, big bathroom, huge heavy curtains everywhere, big windows, strange sliding wooden doors; i kept getting lost; at least 2 bathrooms; the terrace was HUGE and had this fun round sofa that spun around. Directly across from the American Airlines arena. Gave us late (2:00) checkout without asking. It was a fun mini-vacation that I couldn't afford. I'll do it again sometime.
UR16779570	My wife and I stayed at the W for our one year anniversary on June 7th, 2008. We stayed in one of the Spectacular rooms (basic room with a view). The view from our room on the 14th floor of downtown Dallas was great. The room was small, dark and basic. The "open" bathroom was very small and unexceptional as well. Other than the location and the view, I was disappointed by every aspect of the stay. It was certainly not worth the $400 paid to stay here.
UR16287017	A few things have been said in previous reviews about some unfortunate circumstances and I must say that I had experienced some of them during my first stay at the W Dallas. But the place was so suited to my taste that I decided to give them another try and it was well worth the second trip. As an SPG Platinum member, I was placed both times in a â€œmarvelous suiteâ€� and this room has got to be among the best of all the W's I've stayed at (and I've stayed at practically every one in the US). In contrast to the stark and cramped early incarnations of W rooms, this suite was extraordinarily spacious, bright, and airy. The gargantuan two-rooms were furnished with ultra comfy velvety sectionals, funky office chairs, and the usual inviting W signature bed. The living room was so huge that it housed a dining room table large enough to accommodate a wedding banquet. Floor to ceiling windows with sweeping city views and streaming sunshine added to the â€œWoWâ€� factor. Gadgets are the usual for a swanky ultramodern room including extra large plasma TVs and space-age phones. I found the glass-abundant bath room motif chic and stylish but would have to agree with previous reviewers that the layout leaves little privacy for the occupant and even less to the imagination of roommates and service staff. Best extra-room amenity is the very well kept fitness center with, unlike most hotel gyms, actually enough room, weights, and cardio equipment to support a real exercise routine. A noticeable improvement the second go-around was the service. Door staff were in abundance but minus the attitude and more forth coming with service. Front desk check-in and out was considerably warmer and more efficient. A couple of minor glitches (phone not working, bottle opener missing) were expeditiously addressed and all the while, a Whatever/Whenever agent kept track of the fixes until issues were resolved. Room service was particularly pleasant and the meal scrumptious. All in all a fabulous stay at the W-Dallas that I hope I can experience again in the near future.
UR16138831	Stayed at the W Dallas Victory for a business trip recently and thoroughly enjoyed the property. All hotel employees were very friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in making sure you had a fine experience - from the valet at the door to check-in and the concierge. The lobby, while small, is very chic and comfortable and the Living Room bar/lounge is a great place to just relax - have a drink, read the newspaper, get some work done.... I did not eat at the restaurant, Craft, but did receive some helpful advice from the concierge on local hot spots. While some have criticized the location in the new Victory Park neighborhood I thought it was great - even if a little early on in the development of this area. Yes there is a lot of construction going on but it was not obtrusive in any way to me. And you can easily see the potential that will eventually exist here. It was also very convenient to just about every other neighborhood in Dallas I thought. AA arena is literally right across the street. Room was spotless and very comfortable - if you are enjoy a more traditional vibe or decor this is probably not the hotel for you. But I really liked the contemporary yet well thought out design of the room. They are not like some trendy hotel rooms that are designed to be cool looking but are ridiculously impractical. The rain shower head was fantastic! Didn't use pool but the pool deck looks great on the 16th floor. Ghostbar was packed following a Stars hockey game - the balcony is a great place to have a drink and enjoy the view of the Dallas skyline. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel to friends I know would appreciate the vibe. Once again if you are into a more traditonal luxury hotel the W is probably not for you. But if you want contemporary and thoughtful design, business convenience, and a generally hip destination this hotel fits the bill!
UR15659173	Not that hip for a W Hotel. Rooms just ok, with views of a highway under construction. Alot of construction in this area, and nothing special except you are smack across the street from AA Center. Ghost Bar on the roof was very tame for a Thursday night, and one would have expected that since the Mav's game across the street had just finished there would be some activity here, NOT. Have stayed at Crescent Court, Mansion on Turtle Creek and Hotel Zaza. Crescent Court the best out of them all based on hotel experience, location and food choices... Will try Ritz next time around, but so far Crescent Court the best hotel in Dallas in my opinion.
UR15557325	My husband I and stayed a night for our 8th Wedding Anniversary, we used cash and points so the cost $90.00 for a wonderful room. We checked in around 3:45 excited to be in our room, but was not ready. We were greeted with champagne to toast our day though which was nice. The room was not what I expected; very cold and dark was not prepared for the open concept bathroom that awaited us as well. Also you do not have a coffee pot in the rooms you have to request one to be brought up to you, needless to say ours was broken and coffee was everywhere. BUT the story does not end, a few days later I got an online survey to fill out asking about our stay, I was honest and told what our experience was like AND surprisingly I got an email shortly after expressing concern from the W on our hotel stay. We were offered the WOW suite for a very small amount of money and were trying it again, so I will post after we stay again to see if the service and the rooms get better with pictures.
UR15486880	Showed up on a Tuesday night after a 5 hour flight. When I showed up the front desk staff were busy flirting with girls going to the Ghost Bar. Once they did finally acknowledge me, the front desk guy told me even though they had a reservation and card on file for the past week, they gave my room away to "Someone who wanted to extend thier stay". As an apology they sent me to a low rent hotel down the street that normally goes for 1/3 the price and was a step up from a Holiday Inn. When I asked why someone who obviously planned in advance and made reservation would be cast aside in favor of a last minute extension - the front desk guy shrugged and said it was a variety of factors that lead to the move. But refused to provide any of the factors. Net: If you want to ACTUALLY have a room when you arrive - don't go to the W HOTEL.
UR15302155	I stayed at the W to treat myself to a lovely downtown hotel with lots of amenities. The rooms and public areas looked like they were assembled with cheap construction and amenities. This is all subdued by the trendy look and lack of lighting. The air conditioning was inadequate. I am a frequent business traveler and Starwood platinum guest. There are no amenities for established Starwood clients. My room was simple with a view of roads, apartments and construction. The Bliss toiletries were nice, but actually looked like they had been used by someone else prior to placement in my room. I made an appointment for a pedicure and was told that I would be charged even if I cancelled. I arrived at my appointment about 10 minutes early. Turned out there was one manicurist/pedicurist on duty. He was busy with another client and was 45 minutes late for my appointment. The only thing luxurious about this hotel is the pricing.
UR15198838	Booked SPG cash and points, which appears t be quite a bargain (based on the other reviewer's rate info). Indeed, the hotel has a modern/trendy vibe down to the mood lighting and perpetual beat loop on the elevator (that will sometimes "follow" you to other common hotel areas). Wife and I were upgraded to a 3d flloor balcony room due to Gold membership, upon my perpetual ambiguous ("have any upgrade rooms available?") request. Good service, even if you didn't drive onto premises in a Ferrarri. And yes, there were several types like this. Park down the street to the East/South (back toward downtown) and bypass the $26 daily valet. (Scant on street for free). There is also a giant outdoor lot; so long as there is not a game in time, seems a good option for $5 overnight. This area of Dallas has several trendy establishments. Clearly the upper crust lives and plays in this vicinity. Accordingly, we enjoyed our escape. Rainforest shower + free soaps/shampoos were quite enjoyed. Bring your black credit card if you plan to dine at Colichio's Restaurant, order room service, or have more than one cocktail at the silly Ghost Bar.
UR15148329	Stayed there one Friday night. Hotel staff was very nice but could be more helpful (or knowledgeable?). Had a problem with Ghost Bar (see my separate review). Ghost Bar is not run by the W hotel. That said , I would think a hotel and its staff would be able to assist a guest when a problem does occur since the bar does lease space from them and it even allows guests to charge purchases to the hotel room. It took talking to 4 hotel staff members about contacting the bar on my behalf when I discovered I had left my driver's license at the bar. All staff repeated they did not have a contact name to call except for fire. They even said the problem happens all the time so the bar doesn't even try to help their guests. Finally a different staff member took pity on my situation and emailed the corporate office for the bar as a courtesy. There was no guarantee I would be contacted back before Monday. There should be better communication between the hotel and the bar and I think the hotel could have been more sympathetic to my situation. For the money I spent for one night ($400) I expected them to go to bat for me. I would have been very generous in my appreciation if they could have resolved the problem. Instead, I left with bitter feelings toward the bar and disappointment towards the hotel. The hotel rooms are very dark but I did like the modern decor. Very expensive. Craft restaurant for breakfast was expensive ($44 for 2) but very good. I won't go back.
UR14644437	My firend and I stayed at The W for our birthday celebration. We stayed on a Thursday night during the Indy Film Festival which was the only hightlight to the stay. We saw Helen Hunt and Josh Brolin at the hotel. Our room was pricey, 459.00. It was a standard room with a great balcony. The bed was comfy....The bathroom was strange..no outlets, so two ladies trying to fix their hair apply makeup, not so good....I did not like the shower..It was a rainfall shower in the middle of the tub so good luck if you are not trying to get your hair wet...Their is no privacy to the shower but a curtain....All I can say is strange.......We tried the Ghostbar and it was mainly a young 20's hangout with techno music......We looked at the pool it was pretty neat but very small sun deck. We had dinner at the Ritz around the corner and to be honest that was more my style. The W was way to hip for me...
UR14517466	On the positive side: 1. The hotel is very zoomy. 2. The staff are extremely gracious. 3. The room is clean and well kept. 4. The bed is comfortable. On the negative side : 1. It's dark. The hallways and my room were dimly lit. The room's walls and carpet are dark charcoal gray--practically black. It's great until I needed to read. The desk lamp was decorative, but not bright. enough to illumniate the work area. I would have loved more light. 2. The AC fluctuations are disruptive. I heard the compressor kick on and off all night long. Someone else mentioned this in a review. I agree completely. 3. I'm not a fan of the bathroom. For $400 (basic room charge inclusive of tax), I'd like a tub, please. Also, the bathroom configuration is odd. If housekeeping opened the front door while I was in the shower, they'd get an eyeful. There is nothing but a glass wall between the shower and the entry hall
UR14128144	This is a great hotel. Sure, it's a little trendy. But it's the W! Get over it people. Anyway, checkin was very smooth and courteous, the hallway leading to my hotel room was fine (no, not too dark; I disagree with the other reviewer) and my room was amazing. Loved all the nice little touches. Watch out for the wine on the tray and the mini-bar area. Ripoff city! But I did get room service for breakfast which was awesome. Bathroom was also a nice touch and I liked the chair by the work desk. Bed was great. I'd stay there again!
UR14027601	New facilities, very trendy decor. Given the popularity of the Ghostbar as an evening hangout place, was a bit noisy. Otherwise an excellent experience overall.
UR13626123	The lobby and public areas are beautiful. The hallways where the rooms are located are extremely dark. I thought the lights had gone out on the one of the floors, but every floor the elevator stopped at was like this. The room was set up in a weird way. Right inside the entry you have part of the bathroom: The shower and sink. The toilet is in a separate little room and there is a curtain to close off the bathroom area from the bedroom, but NOT from the front door! This makes if very awkward for two people sharing a room. Two businessmen for example could not have one showering while the other has a guest. You can't even have a husband and wife order room service and let one shower, as there is no way to let the Room Service person come in the room past the see-through shower! Even standing in the doorway, the room service person gets a good look at whoever is in the shower. It's just poorly thought out!
UR13264638	My wife and I decided to go to the first annual MystiQal event at Victory Center last Saturday night. She is a Gold Starwood Elite, and we used points for the stay. The check-in was smooth, the room was nice, but the experience in the lobby bar and the deck for the parade were extremely disappointing. Despite the rates charged for the hotel, the hotel became jam packed with street people, mostly drunk 20-somethings that were obviously not staying at the hotel. The Ghost Bar had an extremely rude doorman trying to control the door as well. I realize it was an attempt at trying to replicate Mardis Gras, and you have to put the stay in perspective, however management did a poor job of thinking this through. Long story short, we paid too much, even if it was points, to have a very mediocre experience. "W" may want to replace the word "wish" with "over-rated". on the bed pillow.
UR12920698	There is a difference between "modern" and "trendy". The hotel is definitely designed for the younger generation of club-goers, not so much middle-aged business professionals. I love modern styles, art, music, so if it's done well, there's nothing better. But (and being in my late 20s) I felt that the hotel put fashion before function. Rooms and halls were darkly lit. For the majority of they day, dance music plays, which would be fine except you can usually here it levels above the lobby at all hours. In sleeping rooms, it wasn't always obvious where closets, electrical outlets, or clocks were. In the Living Room - I had to laugh at the poor girls in tight black tank dresses. Sex sells big here. On a positive note - the Ghost Bar is the hippest spot to be, and the hotel's location is conveniently located across from the American Airlines arena. So, if you come to Dallas to party - this is your place. For those more traditional like myself, they are building a Mandarin Oriental across the street.
UR12832195	We stayed one night. The rooms are ok but weird. You will be nickled and dimed at every turn. 9 dollars for a bottle of water!! The staff all look and act like they are the models for calvin klein. Just a strange place. I will not be back.
UR11693678	We stayed here one night for our anniversary. I wanted to see it as I had heard so much and had stayed at a W in NY. We live in Dallas area so this was just a get away. The room was ok but furniture looked cheap and I don't like having my bathroom in the same room as my bed! Service was nice and they had a little welcome gift for us which was nice. Loved the pool! That was my favorite thing. Bed was ok but the room was hot and could not get the temp right. The hotel is over-run by 20 somethings and is very loud at night. We were told on check in that we could go up to Ghost Bar at no cost as hotel guests and that our name was on a "list". After dinner I wanted to see the bar as it was hyped so much. Well there was no list and they charged my husband $15 for the privilige of going up there, I was free... whoopeee! What a disappointment when we got there. This is just a bar where there is no seating because all the seats and tables are reserved for people who are not there and never showed while we were there. We went out on the "see through" balcony which was no big deal. The place was so boring we just left after one drink. that was the bummer of the night. I have stayed at the Mansion and Four Seasons and had a much better time, I will just stick with class over trendy, thank you.
UR11537528	This is place is cool. I mean Too Cool in that degenerate "LA Wannabe" kind of way. Rooms are poorly lit, pretentiously decorated and electrical outlets are hard to find but, hey, who needs electricity? Sorry, I don't need the shower in my bedroom. Redeeming factor - the bed is comfortable. I do not recommend this hotel for middle-aged business travelers.
UR11408860	The hotel is impressive; the rooms are impressive. Everything else was not. Valet service is a joke. They lost our car every single time we went to go pick it up. Room service was horrible, took a hour to get our food on several occasions and every time the food was either cold or just barely warm. The fabulous wall mounted flat panel tv was pretty, but useless. Why have such a great tv if the cable service is deplorable? The people at the front desk were not very friendly. Overall, not impressed with this hotel at all and won't be staying there again. The Cool Corner rooms are impressive, but you pay a lot for them. If you don't have the service to go along with the room, it's just not worth it.
UR11163139	I know what you're thinking...come on...the W is so...TRENDY. Well, it is, but it's fabulous and worth every penny. You get what you pay for, and if you are looking for a cool experience in Dallas, which is hard to find, the W is worth it! Now, I don't mean to bag on Dallas, but as a Dallas native, I often wonder...well...I'll save that for another time. Last Thanksgiving, when home for the Cowboys game, my now fiance and I went to the Ghostbar because I am a huge fan of the one in Vegas...who isn't? I have a cynical perspective on downtown Dallas and the pretentiousness of it all, but I was truly blown away by the W and the Ghostbar. That being said, we were so impressed, we had to book a night at the W this year. As a special ending to our engagement week, we ended the trip with a bang by staying at the W. I just finished writing a thank you note to the manager because we had the most incredible experience! First, the valet greeted us warmly and was extremely friendly. Then, while checking in, Jeff at the front desk struck up a great conversation with us and we were laughing and smiling from ear to ear. My fiance booked the room on points, but Jeff was so kind to upgrade our room because of our engagement. I'm with 407Gator, you cannot deny the fabulousness of the room, the Bliss spa toiletries, the shower, and the comfy robes, the subdued walls, the wall-mounted tv, Voss water, high ceilings, etc. It was all things fabulous. We walked in and had a complimentary half-bottle of wine. The bed was the most comfortable bed and made the Marriott bed seem like a wooden plank with cheap cotton sheets. I stepped out for a bit, where the young man at the door was exceptionally friendly and offered me directions. When I returned, the staff had brought up an exquisite candle with a lovely scent and a card signed by the front desk staff...very nice touch. About an hour later, a knock at the door unveiled another friendly gentleman who brought up a complimentary bottle of champagne, again, with a personalized card signed by the staff. We ordered room service and I had the most unbelievable roasted tomato soup and antipasto salad. My fiance had a burger and fries. That night, we went to the Ghostbar and had incredible service from our lovely server who had to put up with an annoying, drunk friend. She was great. We had a very short stay at this hotel, but I can honestly say it was one of the most if not the most amazing experience. The service is unbeatable, and who cares if it's trendy, it's classy and cool!
UR10579255	My husband proposed to me on our stay here. We had a fabulous suite with a large balcony overlooking downtown Dallas. The staff was amazing- bringing us complimentary champagne and chocolates. We dined at the Craft which had wonderful food and service. The host made sure we made it right up to the Ghostbar afterwards for a celebration. The room was great- my only complaint was the air conditioning unit which was extremely loud and kept me up all night. However- I would definitely stay there again.
UR10544091	I have stayed at the W Hotel in Dallas two times in the last few months, both times for one night while traveling on business. All in all, I have been pleased with my two stays and will likely return to this hotel the next time I travel to Dallas for work. The Positives: 1. Rooms. They are very comfortable and have a cool feeling to them. Both rooms I've stayed in had 32 in LCD TVs with plenty of channels, very comfortable beds and pillows, and decent bathroom areas. 2. Fitness Center. One of the better hotel gyms I have used. They have a full compliment of weight machines, dumbells/benches, and cardio equipment. All of the equipment is very new (along with the hotel itself) and is in good working condition. If you like to work out, you won't be disappointed. 3. Service. Both times I checked in, it was very quick and painless. One touch that I won't soon forget was that they provide you with a card to write down your last name and flight record locater. They will then check you in for your flight and deliver a printed boarding pass to your room. So simple, yet very helpful. A nice little touch that went a long way. Maybe other hotels are doing this, but this was the first time I have come across it. The Negatives: 1. Price. As other reviewers have noted, the prices are a little steep. Even though I was pleased with both of my stays, I would probably not stay here if i was paying out of my own pocket. I believe you can find better values in the Dallas area. 2. Location. This depends on a few things. If you are going to an event at the AA center, it could not be any more convenient. It's directly across the street. If you're not attending an event at the AA center, but there is one going on, traffic can get a little hectic in the area. Also, the first time I stayed there, i arrived at 8:45 PM. By the time I was ready to have dinner (just after 9:00), my options were very limited as many places had already closed (this was a Thursday night). If it's not a game night at the AA center, it is a little lonely in the area after 9:00 PM. 3. Showers. Two things I don't like about the showers. One, there's no door or curtain on them, so if you have the air conditioning on in the room, the opening lets that cool air into the shower. Two, the shower heads are the rain heads that provide a lot of water, but no concentrated stream. I might be in the minority, but I'm not a fan of this style. 4. A little too cool. This one depends on who you ask. It is a W and I guess this is how it's supposed to be. I'm a relatively young guy (33), but to me, this place comes across as trying too hard to be cool. Things such as putting you on the guest list to get into the Ghost Bar and making it seem like it's a huge deal, very mirrored and dark hallways and elevator banks that can be a little disorienting, showers without a door (see above) are all touches that some people might appreciate and others just be annoyed by. I'm somewhere in the middle. In summary, my two stays have been very enjoyable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel. Just know, this is a W and you get all that goes along with that.
UR10127731	I can not tell you how impressed I was with the level of service this hotel and its staff exhibited during my unexpected one night stay. My flight into Chicago was seriously delayed and having passed the W numerous times through Dallas, I thought "Why not?" I have always love the W Hotel's themes and accomodations. I even got married at one! While our bags continued on to Chicago, we checked in, and immediately upon explaining our situation to the front desk, we had toothpaste, toothbrushes, hair brushes, a comb, deodorant, and more brought immediately to our room. Not to mention a serious upgrade to a corner room that overlooks the AA Center and downtown Dallas. (a Junior Suite) They even gave us complimentary W T-Shirts to sleep in. They also arranged for their car service (which works from 6-9 PM within a 3 or so mile radius) to come pick us up and take us to Target for extras. The pool (roof) is amazing. Sort of like an infinity pool. Workout room very spacious and entire hotel CLEAN. The Ghost Bar is atop this large complex which also includes residences. Having been to 3 other W's and numerous Starwoods, I must say, so far this is my favorite! They also have a great AAA rate so ask if you are a member. Again, all I can say is WOW to the W!
UR10084086	This hotel is just bland. It is nice place, but there is nothing real signature about it as I have come to expect from W hotels. Staff are ok. Building is a tall high rise in Dallas; that's it. It's all very nice, but it doesn't really feel like a W experience because there is nothing really memorable about the experience (other than the truffle mac n cheese from service). You just don't really feel anything "neat" about staying here.... you just several hundred a night to stay here and it is kind of blah. Oh and the Dallas crowd just sucks; it is like a real bad version of West LA. We have gotten spoiled by much cooler W's around the country and world.
UR8874761	The hotel itself is nice, but very expensive for what it is. Our concierge was very nice and helpful, and the room was awesome. We stayed there because of how close it is to the American Airlines Center, and that was great. What wasn't great was the ridiculous price I had to pay for Valet, and the fact that the person who took my car when we showed up told me a completely different price from what I ended up paying. The wait for our car was also suspect, especially when someone with a more expensive car shows up. And the attitude we got from security on a Saturday night when we tried to valet our car to get to our room was also uncalled for. It also doesn't help that the valet company the hotel uses is an independent company unaffiliated with the hotel. Overall, our stay was pleasant. The staff were very helpful and nice, and we enjoyed our room.
UR8853015	I have stayed at a number of W hotels with widely variable experiences. The W Dallas is definitely on the better end of the spectrum. The hotel is relatively new, very clean and had well-furnished and designed rooms. There were plenty of outlets, a large flat-screen TV and internet that worked as promised. Room service was prompt and accurately delivered (note - why is it normally so difficult to get proper ice coffee in the South?). The bed is very comfortable and even though I was on a high floor (close to the top floor club) I had no problems with noise. The bathrooms are also well furnished. Most surprising for a W was that I experienced excellent service. Faxes and car valet were promptly delivered and wakeup calls/room service occurred when scheduled. Further, the receptionist offered an upgrade based on my Gold SPG status. The Craft restaurant downstairs was excellent and the club was busy (this on a Tuesday night). I would definitely stay here again.
UR8534791	If you could turn a hip nightclub into a hotel, youâ€™d have the W Dallas Victory Hotel. The W is a beautifully designed addition to Dallasâ€™ growing skyline. Located just on the edge of downtown (at Victory), itâ€™s walking distance to the American Airlines arena and in the middle of tons of new development. The property oozes â€œcoolâ€� with its smartly dressed staff, good-looking guests, swanky downstairs lounge, Bliss spa (with an incredible indoor/outdoor pool somewhere around the 15th floor), and W-themed rooms. Still, most of these cool features are to the hotelâ€™s detriment. So many of the pretty guests were awful to be around. The lounge is a pulsating den of drunk people screaming over the tunes that the DJ spins, and youâ€™ll see that many of these people are locals, not guests, who come to hang out. At the top of the hotel is Ghost bar, which is a study in design gone wrong and people gone â€œwronger.â€� The staff (not the Wâ€™s own) are rude, the guests are obnoxious, and the service is slow. The lines for the elevators that take you up to the bar invade the lobby, and people sometimes wait for hours to get through them. The bar does give you some nice views of the city, and the DJs are probably Dallasâ€™ best, so if youâ€™re into music, itâ€™s worth checking out. We spent two nights at the W and left in a hurry. The rooms are clean, cute, and well designed. The views of Dallas are great, and most of the staff is nice. Sadly, none of that can make up for the guests. Both nights, we were awakened at about 2:30 a.m. by partiers hanging out in the hallways or their rooms. Security was quick to respond both times, but once Iâ€™m awakened by people screaming outside my room, Iâ€™m up! I spoke to the manager on duty, and she was sympathetic. She said that theyâ€™ve been battling noise problems since the hotel opened, but clearly theyâ€™re not doing anything to stem late-night disturbances. The manager deducted $200 from our 2-night bill, but we still paid too much for 2 sleepless nights. I can honestly say that if I were 15 years younger, Iâ€™d be in love with the atmosphere at the W. But at the ripe age of 34, I couldnâ€™t be persuaded to stay there again. The rooms are nice, new, and clean, but the clientele are inconsiderate, and the hotel is too concerned with its being perceived as cool to do anything about the nightclub mentality that pervades everything onsite.
UR8490184	WARNING for visitors to the W Hotel who are planning on having dinner at Craft and valet parking your vehicle. Craft is over priced for the mediocre food. For the price (upwards to $98 for kobe steak), I would expect to be served with a beautiful presentation, BUT this restaurant serves their meals family style... think mash potatoes and green beans being passed around the table during thanksgiving. The table shares the salad, main course and dessert. The major warning is the W Hotel's valet parking. BE CAREFUL when handing your keys to the valet. Our valet, while driving our car, was involved in a wreck. The valet would not tell us that the car was involved in an accident. We had to ask where our car was and that was when they finally told us what happended. The "manager" and his valet walked away from our car and would not help or take responsibility, although we entrusted our vehicle to them. Eventhough the valet was DRIVING our car, they acted as if we were behind the wheel and left it to us to exchange info with other driver, call the tow truck, etc. The W Hotel will not take responsibility, blaming the restaurant. The restaurant will not take responsiblity, blaming the valet. The valent will not take responsiblity, blaming the other driver. If you go to the W Hotel, hope that nothing happens to you, because they will just turn their back and ignore it. Better yet, avoid the W and the over-priced family style restaurant with high prices.
UR8419348	This hotel is a total scene. That being said, it was surprisingly down-to-earth as far as the staff. One of the best check-in/check-out that I have ever experienced. W Hotels are not really known for the staff being "nice" - they are more like model/actors waiting for their big break. Lobby/bar areas are beautiful and spare. The hallways are super creepy, dim, and the mirror at the end of the hallway gave me a bit of a start until I realized it was my reflection (haha). Room was wonderful and very spacious. The bed, the rain showerhead, flat-screen plasma tv could not be beat. The view from my room was on construction, but not a big deal. The valet was HORRIBLE. They were friendly, nice, and helpful, BUT I waited over a half hour for my car at a "slow" time (930pm), and at check out, I called ahead and still waited 20 minutes and that was late as well (1230pm).
UR8404690	I stayed this past weekend for my bachelor party and our hotel experience for the most part was excellent. We booked a Cool Corner Suite and was not let down. It was a little smaller than I anticipated, but it worked out for everyone. The door staff was awesome and really helpful. Upon unloading our vehicle they had noticed that we had bought some "adult beverages" and told us that we had to conceal it, or they wouldn't let us in with it. They were cool in that they helped us conceal it and make sure that we got it up to the room. They also helped us make reservations for typical bachelor party establishments and allowed us access to the hotel SUV rather than calling for a cab. Later on we came back and went to the Ghostbar. We were told 2 people per room could get in without paying (I assumed free). When I got the bill the next morning I saw there was a $30 Ghostbar charge, and come to find out we were charged $15 per person, instead of the normal $20 cover charge. I was pretty disappointed by this as I was led to believe by the check-in staff that it was free. The Ghostbar is awesome with tons of beautiful people. The service is good and the people never really seemed "snotty" or stuck-up. We will definitely go back to the Ghostbar the next time we are in town, likely to be OU/TX weekend.
UR8052828	I loved staying in the W it was beautiful very close to downtown and very modern. I guess I understand why older people dont like it as much as younger people do, but i recommend it to everyone!
UR8039261	We stay at all Starwood properties when we travel and have stayed in most of the W Hotels across the country. Although the hotel lobby is beautifully decorated and the service is above standard, the Dallas crowd at this hotel left us feeling like we had crashed a bachelorette party for a few hundred of Britney Spears best friends. This is definitely a hotel to 'be seen in' for Dallas-ites and the loud, techno music and scantilly clad guests weren't quite what we were looking for for our anniversary getaway. If you're in your early twenties and like to party, this is the hotel for you! If you're used to the smooth and sexy, more sophisticated W Hotels on the West Coast, you'll be very disappointed in this property. PS. You might want to bring a flashlight to maneuver the hallways to your room!
UR8036355	I am a corporate travel agent and I love good hotels. I was very excited to stay at the W Dallas Victory. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. We arrived and entered the lobby. The girl that checked us in was great! She was very friendly and not snobby at all. (We didn't exactly look like the cream of society, having been bird watching all day) When she was taking information from me the music was so loud she kept having to have me repeat myself. She said she always had problems with it and the later it got the louder it got. She did give me some recommendations on food and told me about the bars. We went up to our room, which was a very odd set up. As others have said, you walk through the bathroom to get into the main part of the room. I found that a bit off putting. The bathroom is very nice, but.... The bath is also open onto the room, though there are drapes you can draw. That didn't appeal to me at all. The sleeping part of the room was really nice. The bed was great, with wonderful pillows. There was a really nice chaise lounge and a plasma screen tv. I did notice that the duvet looked like a cat had walked across it, picking some of the threads with its claws. We had trouble with a lot of noisy partyers on our floor. Also,we are early to bedders, and at about 11PM there was a knock on our door. My husband answered it and someone said they had the pillow we had asked for. We didnt ask for a pillow. The final blow was when we went to check out. We had valet parked the car and they couldnt find my key! It took about 20 minutes to get the car. Over all the location is good. I like the chic modern style and the staff was very nice. I think that we were just there on a bad night, but I will have a hard time recommending this hotel to my clients.
UR8020450	I liked the W very much. I liked the color change of The Living Room bar and the drinks were very tasty, although a bit expensive but it is a W. There was also a free laptop connected with wi-fi for use in the lobby, which was very handy for me since I forgot my laptop adaptor at home. There were a few odd details about the place: 1) My cover sheet was kind of shredded - not like big giant gaping holes but the stitching was definitely coming out like maybe a cat had jumped on it. Which was odd, considering the hotel's attention to detail and the fact that it is not very old. 2) The glass wall that separates the shower from the sink left me bruised on the top of my head. It is very thick glass. 3) The pool on the 16th floor has a very thorough set of rules of what can be done and what can not be done in the pool, including no blowing of your nose. Useful - yes. Annoying - definitely. Also, I would think the pool on the other side of the landing would have been a better place for it - instead of a view of Downtown Dallas, you get a view of the highway and a construction zone. Overall, I would definitely stay there again and it will be a lot nicer once the construction is done next to the hotel.
UR7846627	The last couple of reviews are really off base in my opinion. This place is not for everyone - let's get that out of the way. It is hyper-modern, and yes, the rooms and hallways are painted a dark color. So what, it works! Very dramatic effect. The lobby is like a really cool movie set, and has very different feelings at night and in daytime. The guy who checked me in could not have been nicer, a really pleasant fellow who was not in the least bit snobby. The doormen and every other staff member I encountered were unfailingly pleasant and polite, always with a smile and a hello. The elevators have piped in music. The hallways are dark but not in a dangerous way. Maybe other posters are exaggerating a bit? I was upgraded to a "Spectacular View King" on a higher floor. It was a big room, with the bathroom just inside the entrance, tiled in charcoal gray. The shower was great, and the Bliss toiletries are very nice - worth bringing home. There was a big plasma, a nice sized desk and a big, comfortable backless sofa in front of the window. But the highlight for me was the bed - wow was it comfortable, even better than the Westin Heavenly Bed. You will not want to get out of bed in the morning. Best.Bed.Ever. Oh, as for the "hidden" electrical outlets, there are two behind the TV and one in the base of each nightstand lamp. So what is the issue, people? The wake up call was a live person, always a nice touch, and she was on time for the firs and follow-up and was very pleasant. Also pleasant was my server in the bar restaurant, Tara. She was very sweet and very efficient. That was nice after a long and delayed flight. Valet parking was fine, unlike other posters' experiences. Just call down from the room before you need the car. Altogether, a very nice experience. I will return when next in the Big D.
UR7840538	After staying here last February when the hotel was new, I thought it needed to make some improvements. After staying here again this month (June) I think the improvements are awesome! Check-in was a breeze, getting a hotel car to a special event was very easy thanks to the very capable and most accomodating Concierge, Eloy. This guy goes over and above to make guests happy! Room service was perfect, great bar service, wonderful food - everything was top-notch! The staff there is exceptionally friendly, and that really makes the hotel extra-special. I think this is the place to stay in Dallas!!
UR7818409	If you like Dark, Gay and Cheap at very high prices, you will love this place. However if you want a what a $400 room should get you, go somewhere else. This place is a ripoff. At $89 a night I would have rather stayed in a Motel 6. The $400 room was not large, the walls were dark gray almost black with dark carpeting. To get any light you have to open the curtains on the smaller than normal window all the way. The shower is separated from the bedroom by a curtain, yes a curtain -- no wall or door. The hallways are so dark it feels like you are in a cave. I kept waiting for someone to jump out and mug me.
UR7762678	When in Dallas (for business) I always stay at the Grand Hyatt at the Airport (one of my favorite hotels to date - don't laugh - it is a first rate hotel and perfect for business travelers). However, I thought I would try this place since it is fairly new. What a waste of time and money. Wish I would have read the not so great reviews prior to my stay - they were all spot on! First, location is totally awkward. Second, the place is run by a completely amateur staff. Young kids have been clearly hired for their alleged "hipness" but the simple things - directions, printing boarding pass, check-in - seemed a bit beyond this crew's capabilities. Conceriege seemed totally perplexed that we were asking for help. As one previous reviewer said, this place is trying way too hard to be hip and cool and in doing so, it is actually just quite humorous to see all these people taking themselves so seriously as they pretend to know how to work in a hotel. Ghost Bar is OK but no real views to speak of. Room layout, as one previous reviewer indicated, is completely odd. Good luck finding electrical outlets for a hair dryer - none in the "bathroom" area. Hint - look behind the LG flat screen TV. Also, for such a new hotel, I was shocked at how run down it appears to be already. Furniture looks like they picked it up at a Wal-Mart clearance sale. Its all nicked and cheaply made and doesn't at all fit with decor. Rugs in halls and rooms are already worn. Take a pass on this place. Check out the Grand Hyatt at the airport instead - you won't be disappointed!
UR7724902	My only other experience with the W is in Atlanta at Perimeter Center and while the service is nice, the rooms are only mediocre. The W Dallas Victory was one of the best hotel experiences ever! This has surpassed the Ritz Carlton as far as room features, service, and price. Everyone I interacted with was nice and personable. I truly appreciated everything that was done for me (dry cleaning, room service, luggage handling) and I can't wait to go back. Thank you to everyone there! You are the best and your service is unmatched!
UR7722629	my boyfriend and i thought we picked out maybe one of the best hotels in dallas to stay for his 21st birthday for one night but sadly we were wrong.. first off the hotel has pretty nice things inside i have to say but the service was horrible...it strarted off they told us about the ghost bar and their swimming pool and we were pretty excited.. when we first got there the valet was stand right outside of the front door and seemed really nice at first i gave them a $20 tip and.. "usually always did" i went inside to check in which it was not crowed but took a long time to check in finally they kept talking about the ghost bar and saying how we have to go. we finally got into our room which was nice and had a pretty view, we stayed in a wonderful room. we got all dressed to check out the pool because we saw all these cool pictures of it online we finally went up to the top floor to check it out and they never informed us the pool was having some type of construction going on the and pool had no water in it... we went down stairs to ask what was going on the the front desk said they had no idea about the pool being like this and they would give us a late check out till 2:00 the next day so we could swim before we left and we finally were okay with that so we went back up to the room and saw some snacks in the room we called the front desk to ask how much the snack were or if they had something in the room that said it well they told us since it was his bday the snacks and all the beverages in the room would be free so we ended up of course eating some a getting a few drinks then we down to the ghost bar and dressed up pretty nice... but my bf ended up bring some flip flops which i dont know but they were okay looking ones and his outfit still looked pretty nice when we got down there his name was on this list for his bday to have a couple of free drinks they ended up not even letting us in the bar bc of the shoes... which there was barely anyone in there and they were not really bad.. they told us it was a casual dress code but to at least wear a dress shirt which he did and i dressed up.so we never got to do that bc of the flip flops then the food and drinks turned out not to be free so they lied and never opened the pool the next day either and made us leave by 12 the valet men i noticed alot went through my car bc my glove box was open and i noticed alot of my stuff on my car was out all in the front seat... i guess the tip wasnt good enough! They also seemed to have run up my bfs credit card $300 extra dollars right before we left saying we ended up no getting the special deal they had going on for memorial day which they said would go on a few days after that day guess it didnt...
UR7714137	The hotel was very cool and modern, however the set up of the room was weird. You have to go through the bathroom to get to the door and they're is no door for the bathroom. This can be a problem. If someone is in the shower and room service comes they have go through the bathroom to get to the bedroom. This is very weird. The staff was great. They forgot to do somthing I requested and they went above and beyond to fix the problem,
UR7668590	I stayed in the WOW suite ($599.00 per night) and it was amazing. The view was the best part. The 158 sq. foot baclony overlooks the American Airlines Center. The rooms are nice, but definitely could be nicer given the price. The Good: The Hotel is very hip and trendy. Friendly staff. I was escorted to my room. Great pool even though it should face the opposite direction towards Dallas. The bed was very comfortable and the showers were nice. The Bad: The price...WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. It's not worth it. I'd pay $400 maybe for what I had. You have to be very very careful about what your final charge will be. They nickle and dime you to no end! Everything is overpriced. My room was $599 and my final bill was over $800!!!! I got a room, a beer, and some jelly beans and next thing I know I get an $800 charge. Absolutely insane. I will not stay there again to be honest. Helpful tips: Don't tip the valet until after you check out ($24 overnight). Bring your own alcohol. Hide it in your luggage. Don't eat anything at the hotel or in the room!!! Don't touch anything that has a seal on it or you'll get charged. Be prepaired to pay much much more in taxes for the room. There's a list a mile long of different taxes. USE A CREDIT CARD! NOT A DEBIT CARD! If you use a debit card to pay, they will pre-authorize your account with a very very large amount of money (my room $599, they authorized $840). They say it's to cover any incidental damage if needed. They won't tell you any of this when you check in. Overall, the hotel was very nice and my guests has a great time. I won't be going back there until I'm a multi-millionaire without a care in the world about what I'm charged. If you don't know to ask something, they won't tell you so keep reading these reviews. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6. Bottom line: If you're filthy rich, this is the place for you.
UR7567846	When I drove up I wasn't sure if I was even in the right spot since the front entrance didn't have the standard covered, welcoming enterance. I actually thought I might have pulled up in the loading dock or something. Fortunatly the valet guys were there to assure me I was in the right spot. 24 bucks later my car is parked (you'll get the bill). Walking in, its not totally impressive, just different. There is a huge bar with massive hanging crystals or something, and the lobby is fairly small and seemingly only lit by natural light coming through the many windows. The music is strange. I'm escorted to the desk where a guy with a fro hawk and piercings is there to check me in. It was very quick and easy, but I was confused when they told me they would bring my bags up. After thinking, "I can do this myself," I decide to let them do their job and go to my room. A few minutes after getting to my room one of the employees brings me my bags and give me a clever run down of my room while it positions them. ok ok enough, time to leave little man. I reserved 2 nights on the "exclusive 3rd floor room." I walk in and i'm very pleased. You literally have an open shower, the room is larger than normal and the 'exclusive' 3rd floor has a huge, no roof, balcony with an Excellent view of downtown Dallas, athough you can't see it from your bed. The balcony furniture is made of wicker or something and none of it offers you any shade, but i guess it would be great for sunning yourself. The bed is awesome, there is a big flat screen, DVD player, small fridge, comfortable furniture and internet (10 bucks a day). I stayed very comfortable in my room. The location was great! I had Mavs tickets and its literally right across the street. I walked to Dealy plaza in a few minutes, saw the 6th floor museum, had some mexican and margaritas, and the walk back to the hotel was short. Drinking at the hotel is expensive but your surrounded by beautiful people and as a guest your granted access to the 33rd floor club. Its 20 bucks for dudes but my date got in free. 80 bucks later, i'm feeling good and retreat to my room, which takes no time to get back to. The hotel staff was great. They try a bit hard but its appreciated when your having a get away weekend. They let me use their printer for my tickets, they gave me advice on where to eat, it was "yes Mr. Hale" when I called the hotel information. They even went out to my truck to get my forgotten phone charger and brought it to me. Check out was easy, the bill was outrageous
UR7365197	Having read several bad reviews of the service at the W Victory, I was hesitant to book a room there for a recent stay in Dallas. I was also hesitant given the fact that the prices I'd seen listed for the property were considerably higher than any I'd seen at other W hotels. However, when I saw that I could get a decent room for under $300 per night, I figured it was worth checking it out for a couple nights anyway. I guess that hotel has taken quite seriously the complaints they've received, because with only one exception, we found the service and the staff to be exceptional at the W Victory. They are now on a par with other W hotels at which I've stayed, which means their service is much better than your average hotel. We had no problems with air conditioning, staff attitude, nor cover charges for Ghostbar. (As hotel guests, we were allowed to enter Ghostbar without paying any cover. This was on a Tuesday night; perhaps it's a different situation on Friday or Saturday.) The food at Craft is better than your average restaurant, and the service is even better. However, I'm not entirely convinced that the food is worth what they charge for it. I have to say that I am particularly disappointed in their coffee, but obviously, that's not the reason people go there. I'm also a vegetarian, so perhaps those that eat meat would enjoy their dishes more. Worthy of a special mentions are Susan and Sidney (Sydney?), who work at the Whatever/Whenever desk. We didn't have any particularly unusual requests, but they handled those we gave them swiftly and without any problems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that a special request submitted a few days before my arrival was fulfilled. I requested a larger bathrobe because the standard size is way too small for me. A 2X sized one was hanging on a hook in my room when I arrived. The only criticism I'd have is of the "welcome ambassadors," who were the worst I've experienced at W hotels. It wasn't just the first one that failed upon our arrival; they were repeatedly disappointing. They tended to not open doors for us, didn't welcome us back to the hotel on our return and (with one exception) were never there to help us get a cab as we were told they would at the W/W and front desks. In contrast to the rest of the staff, which seemed to go out of its way to be friendly and polite, these guys seemed completely disinterested. There were a couple of times where I felt like some of them did just what they're supposed to, but I'd say that happened perhaps 5% of the time we came and went. Reviews that mention the hotel having young and beautiful staff are on the money; a lot of the people working for the hotel are very attractive 20-year-olds. Yet this is no longer at the expense of competence and professionalism anymore, as sounds like might have been the case before.
UR7342157	The "W" Hotel in Dallas Victory Park is awesome! from the moment we arrived we were treated like celebrities. We had received prior to our visit an email asking the purpose of our trip. I mentioned we were going to Dallas from California to celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary on April 6th. When we arrived at the front desk they were very friendly and professional. They handed me a card welcoming us to the hotel and offering complimentary valet parking. I had reserved a standard room. The Lobby is hip and very upscale, the general colors are soothing and chic. All the staff were always pleasant and polite. We went up to our room and were surprised that we had been upgraded to a suite, room 1401, stunning views of Dallas modern skyline on one side, and on the other side of the ultra large balconey the American Airline Arena. The room was ultra modern, luxurious and just beautiful. It was large, the size of a loft or an apartment and furnished with top of the line flat screens, two, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The room had beer, champagne, salsa, and chips to help us celebrate our anniversary with our friends. It had two bathrooms stocked with Bliss spa products.and 4 robes. The living room had an extra large modular grey L shaped suede couch. The dinner area had a large table with 6 white leather chairs. The bedroom had a chaise with magazines and books for a soothing reading spot overlooking the downtown skyline. The bed was wonderful! We went to dinner and returned with around 15 friends and relatives and had room to spare, they are all from Dallas and were impressed with the cool and hip suite. We also found more goodies and chocolates had been sent to our suite. I have traveled the world and stayed in many hotels. But I will tell you this by far was the best stay we have ever had. Their attention to detail is unmatched. A true jewel for Dallas, Dallas should be very proud because the "W' Hotel Victory Park Dallas has a WOW and HIP factor that delivers. Bravo to the staff and the manager!
UR7318524	We stayed at the W Hotel for my birthday and had a very nice visit. I had read some negative reviews earlier so I contacted the hotel directly and they assured me with 2 phone conversations that they opened last summer and have now worked out the original issues. We checked in about 3:30 pm and were given the suite I had booked 3 months earlier. We had a WOW suite (#1401) which in on the north end of the hotel so it has a fabulous view of American Airlines Center and all the large electronic boards in Victory Park. (If fact on Sunday, American Airlines Center aired the entire Stars game on the large monitor so we sat in our room eating yummy takeout from nearby Luna de Noche for brunch at the suite's dining room table and watched the game.) The suite is over 1000 square feet and has 2 complete baths, a large room with a sectional couch that seats 6-7, a chair, a dining room table with 6 chairs and a desk with a chair. There is a very large Flat Screen TV mounted over the desk that was great for watching DVDs (bring your own) or regular TV. Two sides of this large room are floor-to-ceiling windows so the view is great. (Drapes close to make the room dark enough to feel like a movie theater.) There is a 150 square foot adjoining terrace with a couch out there. It was fun to stand on the terrace and look directly down on Victory Park and watch the people come and go from the games at American Airlines Center. The separate bedroom is nice size with more windows (but you hear no traffic because you are so high up), a chaise lounge and another wall-mounted TV with DVD. The bed is like a Westin heavenly bed so it was very comfy. The bathtub is nothing special but was good enough. The room had the Bliss sinkside 6 which is 6 of Bliss' most famous products so that was extra nice. (In fact the suite had 1 set of 6 in each bath so I had plenty to take home for future trips.) (If you are staying at the W you are entitled to 20% off all Bliss products in the Bliss spa on the 16th floor.) The room did have gray-blue paint on some walls and I can see how some people would find that bit dark and dull but we didn't have a problem with that due to all the great windows. The furniture is modern but still comfortable. There is a mini-refrig, a safe and 2 closets in the room too. The only issue we had was that we had to call a couple times for the staff to pick up some trash bags that we had left outside our door after we cleaned up after a small party. Perhaps no one does that from 2 am to 8 am? We called again and they came pretty quickly. We just didn't want our neighbors complaining about trash in the hall. Overnight Valet is $24 and it did take a bit of time to get our car out but it was Saturday night about 11:30 pm and lots of people were coming to Ghostbar (their trendy club on the 33rd floor). I mentioned that at checkout and they took it off my bill so that made the 30-35 minute wait acceptable. Be sure to walk around the hotel and see the BLISS spa on the 16th floor (I had a wonderful manicure there and they have a steam room, shower and quiet room), the Larry North workout room SWEAT (where we saw Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman working out) and Ghostbar on the 33rd floor (cover is free for women and $20 for men). You really should go walk on the glass terrace that sticks out over the sidewalk where you can look straight down 33 floors. It is very cool. You can go from 8 pm to 10 pm before the crowd or later when it is busy and people-watch. There is also a very nice lounge/bar on the ground floor by the checkin desk with comfy couches and the 5 star CRAFT restaurant (from NYC) is on the lobby floor too. We didn't try room service so we can't comment on that. (The chocolate cake sent up by the general manager for my birthday was very good so we can recommend that.) The pool was closed for temporary repairs on our visit but usually it is open and it is very unique and cool for it is on the 16th floor which is in the middle with the W building: the bottom 1/2 of the building (floors 1 to 15) is the hotel and the top 1/2 of the building is the condos (floors 17-32). Overall, the W Dallas is a very nice place. The staff is young like the other reviewers mentioned but we found them to be very friendly and helpful. FYI: We brought our 2 small children and no one ever stared at us or acted unfriendly. Granted most guests are under 30 with no kids but you could bring your kids here is you wanted to. More and more restaurants are opening in the area so it will just be easier and easier to stay down there and walk around and not need a car. House of Blues is coming soon and Dick's Last Resort, Luna de Noche and Hooters are open now. We recommend this hotel for a special Dallas weekend with modern accents. I live in the area and I don't know of any other hotel like this in Dallas.
UR6844205	We have eaten at Craft at the W more than 6 times over the past 3 months. It's a great place to eat. The food and service is excellent. The problem has been the last two times we have eaten there, the Valet Captain has been extremely rude. We like to eat at Craft before the Mavericks basketball game. When doing so, it makes sense to park at the W, eat at Craft and walk over to the game. The Valet captain went out of his way to tell us it would cost $100 to valet our vehicle if we did not move it before the game. I always tip $20 for valet. I don't feel the Valet Attendents or Valet Mgt. need to hassle guests of the hotel and Restaurant (Craft) for good paying customers. These guys are extremely arrogant and should be happy with $20 tips. Beware if they try and make you pay $100 to valet your vehicle.
UR6810027	I will have to say I was a little worried going and spending the money for a hotel that had a lot of bad reviews, but after going I was glad I went. The hotel is very trendy, if your looking for traditional do not stay at the W. I found the service to be great, I used the valet and had no problems getting my car or having to wait for an extended time frame. Now if you came about 10:30 P.M. on a weekend and tried to leave after the ghostbar closed I could see having to wait a long time. The rooms were great, I loved the open glass shower and had no complaints with water presure. The whole hotel was filled with georgous people, never seen so many all in one place before. I had a wonderful time there and am looking forward to returning and trying one of their Wow rooms.
UR6799097	I guess it was hip and we are not-but the minimalist look got in the way of comfort in so many ways. The lobby was freezing, the room was so hip there were no drawers for our clothes, the guest services book-was not a book but little cards that were hard to read. The one on the gym (Sweat) did not give any info. Finding Sweat was impossible without calling and asking for directions. However, once there it was truly great. The shower was cool to look at but the one head is in the ceiling and just rains straight down-no tub and no doors. With valet parking basic room was $400-- they charge an additional $11 bucks a day for wireless service-- come on how cheezy is that. Enjoyed Craft, the waiters were great- not at all too hip. Food was excellent and service was relaxed but efficient. When this place becomes unhip it is in trouble, because there is little in the way of comfort and convenience- high priorities for these travelers.
UR6777652	I stayed here for a business meeting. I had never been at a W Hotel before and I have to be honest, I never will again. As a woman traveling alone on business, I found the BLACK walls and VERY dim light in the hallways quite scary. The mirrors at the end of the hallways made it look like EXACTLY like the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ride in Disney World. I had a nice room, but again the walls were BLACK and the lighting was so dim. It also took me FOREVER to find a socket to plug the hair dryer into since the socket plates were also black on a black wall. I will say that the staff was very friendly and helpful, however I was totally out of my element. I am not into hip and trendy hotels. If you like the nightclub scene this is the place for you. But I think next time I will pass.
UR5985910	This has to be one the most pretentious hotels in the USA, with no real reason for being so. From the moment you arrive to see upwards of 6 bell boys all dressed in khaki shorts to the minute you leave you will be amazed at how surface over substance runs right through this hotel's attitude to service. Make no mistake, there has been a lot of money spent on this establishment but you never feel welcome. The room was comfortable but somewhat cold in its design. The public areas are more like a boutique shop than a place you would want to relax. The attitude of the young lady who checked us out was astonishing in its coldness and complete lack of charm. She never asked if everything was ok or if we had enjoyed our stay. Just a "there's your bill", not even a goodbye! I will watch with interest future reviews of this place.
UR5904363	I simply stand aghast at all the negative reviews this hotel is consistently getting. I'm really convinced it's the attitude and mindset of a lot the reviewers thinking this is just another hotel. It's not. This is one of the biggest, hippest things that's ever happened to the City of Dallas and as a result, there's a lot more to deal with among "guests" and staff. To me, you have to go in with a certain mentally if you are to stay here. Dallas happens to be the "LA of the South" and this new W is one of the best "see and be scene places" in DFW, and I've lived here for the past 20 years and there aren't many. So you have to come in here with certain expectations. Attitude may be present among certain staffers but it's only because their guard is up. They have to deal with a line that snakes out the front door past the front desk and reception in the lobby every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights with people trying desperately to get in to Ghostbar. So they've seen and heard it all. If you go in wearing anything other than khakis or sweatpants you should be fine. But if you aren't dressed for "the scene" on Saturday night, you might feel out of place. Yes, the rooms are some of the most expensive in W's portfolio nationwideâ€¦but that might be because it's months old and other than Hotel ZaZa, no other hotel fits it's theme in DFW. Half the building is hotel (up to floor 16, which features the only infinity edge pool at any Dallas hotel to my knowledge), while the other half are residences. The views are either of downtown or along I-35 with pretty much just a power grid to look at. A lot of clubbers come here on the weekends to go to Ghostbar, so you probably will have better service outside of "clubbing" times. My July experience went flawlessly, check-in did take quite a while, requiring an inexperienced staffer making several trips to the back (off to see the "wizard") checking with her manager to ensure I received my SPG Gold upgrade to the next available class of room (which was a terrace, worth the waitâ€¦more on that later). After about 20 minutes had passed and attempting several "over rides" I got my room. Keep in mind this was over July 4 th weekend and it was 2:00 PM in the afternoon, so they cut me a lot of slack. I also booked this room with the expectation that they would provide me with all my "Bliss Spa" goodies in room that was part of a packaged deal. Since nothing was mentioned of this upon check in, I figured they wouldn't be waiting for me in my room like I wanted. As this room was a surprise for my girlfriend's birthday, I had to go get her and called letting them know I booked a package and they were unfamiliar with what was on offer. I had to go down the list of what I was promised (I probably should have requested the kitchen sink, they would've thrown that in too they were so clueless). Butâ€¦upon arrival hours later, everything was in room as promised and they even list candles, turned down the room, and had their signature CD playing. Pool scene was great during the day. Yes it is not really in the sun, but you can pull loungers out into the water covered sun areas. And yes, there aren't many places to lounge around but there again there aren't many rooms here so I never saw it packed. Service from the pool bar was great, offering several good menu items and drinks, if a little pricey. Also there is a walk-up bar in case you need something NOW and don't wanna wait for a server to approach you. Only downer was a freak thunderstorm blew threw and shut down the whole pool area, with staffers coming to secure all furniture and run people off (for their "safety"). That's Texas though, storms here are fierce. On my most recent October visit, I again used my SPG Gold status and wanted a skyline view room as all I booked was bargain basement. First room was so smoke ridden all it took was opening it 6 inches and then I slammed it shut. Looks like a trip down to the front desk is in order! Immediately upon approach, several staffers said "what's wrong?" very concerned I came back so quickly. I replied "it's a little smokey" then one of the bell hops overheard and said "he's just being nice, he could really let you have but won't". In amazing "guest service recovery," fashion the attendant was very sympathetic wanting to know the room number again, the floor, and then offered us a complimentary upgrade to a $700 a night suite! He personally walked us up, made sure the room was alright this time, and that was that! I ended up taking several pics which you'll see attached to my review. The concept suite was amazing. This could easily sleep 6. Living room had tiled entry, half bath, living room with sectional sofa, dining room seating 6, plasma TV, Bang and Olufsen stereo, separate HVAC. Bedroom had plasma, DVD, sofa, Heavenly Bed, rain shower, Bliss Spa amenities, bath robes, and separate entry. All in all don't let a lot of these negative reviews turn you off. Doâ€¦ 1) Get Starwood Preferred Guest membership so you can get free upgrades and 4 PM checkout (both honored here) 2) Expect to pay $15 if you're a guest ($20 if not) for cover into the Ghostbar high atop the hotel, only if you're male. Females are in free no matter the day or time. 3) Pay at least $5 for valet if you're just going for the Ghostbar or anything else besides an overnight stay. $22 for daily valet parking. 4) Expect South snobbish, trendy attitude. But don't give it back and most of it will all melt away. Walk in with confidence. 5) If it's Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night dress accordingly. Like you're going "out" for an evening. Upon entering you'll be flashed with blue and red "tunnel" type walls. Think Space Mountain entry. Dallas is really a "developing nation" when it comes to 4 and 5 star chic, luxury hotels. Next year we finally get a long-anticipated Ritz Carlton, then in 2009 a Mandarin Oriental. But in the mean time your only options are the W and ZaZa. I'm sticking with the W, if only for the Ghostbar and pool.
UR5811724	An unbelievable horror show. From the dysfunctional valet parking arrangement to the rude front desk personnel to the dirty rooms with stingy amenities, this place makes roadside hourly motels look good. This is not just a loud poorly designed hotel with a trendy nightclub, it's a trendy nightclub attached to a horrible hotel . If you want to see the Ghost Bar, stay somewhere else and take a cab.
UR5801653	I've stayed at several Ws across the US and was excited to stay here to celebrate my 30th birthday. However, after reading these reviews, my expectations were pretty low. The GOOD - this is one of the better looking Ws I've stayed in. A lot seem to be dark and small, but this one was very spacious and had great light and colors. The Bliss spa was also nice, but a little overpriced for Dallas spas. The Sweat gym by Larry North was fantastic - great machines and variety, even though no one was in there. The valet and staff members were helpful and pleasant. The BAD - I really think this hotel is overpriced for what you get. We booked a package deal that included about 5 "do this and get this for free" items, but I only took advantage of 2. The pool is pretty to look at, but you can't find a seat and it's in total shade. The water was freezing and no one could bare to step in. Probably the biggest draw for this place is the ghostbar. We were told to line up in the Hotel "VIP" line by at 11:30 to get in, but don't believe that. We got down on a Sat. night around 9:30 and still had to wait about 30 min. to go up. Granted, the views are pretty awesome when you get there, but it's not as great as the line would lead you to believe. As a previous poster said, if you're looking for the hip atmosphere without breaking the bank, I prefer the Zaza over the W.
UR5709840	I originally booked a room with 2 Queen beds w/ a deck overlooking the city almost 2 months prior to arriving. There were going to be 4 of us staying, and it was for a bachelorette party, so we definitely wanted a balcony/patio to make things special. Well, when we arrived, they told us that our "Wonderful Room with a Deck" (yes, that's actually how they describe it to you) was not available. They offered us another room w/ 2 Queens but it didn't have a deck, and, of course, that was one of our musts. So then they offered us a corner suite w/ 1 King bed, which was much bigger than the original room we booked, plus it had a huge terrace. We were told we could get a roll-away bed brought up to solve the issue of too many girls and not enough beds. When we got to our room, it literally smelled like a fresh pile of dog crap, and I noticed a wet spot on the floor. They do allow pets in this hotel, so it's not at all unlikely that they had just cleaned up a dog mess prior to our arrival. Luckily, our bellman noticed this as well, and called for house keeping to take care of the problem. Overall, the room was pretty amazing, and it was a definite upgrade from the original room we would have stayed in, and the best part was that we didn't have to pay any extra for it. The terrace was absolutely gigantic, and had a huge piece of furniture for lounging on. The room was huge and had two chaise lounges. The bathroom had a wonderful sunken tub, and there was a window that looked out onto the terrace. And the bed was by far one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Cons: For only being open a few months, the room was already showing signs of wear. The bedspread was snagged in many places, the metal accent tables were all scratched up on the top, and there were some scuffs on the wall. There were also some dirty spots on the cushions on the furniture on the terrace. The area w/ the toilet had a sliding door which kept getting stuck. One girl actually got stuck in the bathroom and we had to call maintenance to get her out. Now, back to the service. If I were to make a generalization, I'd say the service is better during the day/early evening then it is at night/ in the wee hours of the morning. We requested an iPod dock (they have them available for check-out), which they located and brought to us. House keeping did arrive promptly to take care of the odor issue (although they were more than a little over-zealous with the air-freshener). Someone called us from the front desk to ask me what time I wanted the roll-away bed brought up (I said 11 pm). And here's the bad. Someone in our group brought a bottle of champagne to the front desk to be delivered to up to the room for our guest of honor at a later time. We went out for a little bit that evening, came back to the room, and instead of the correct bottle of champagne, we had a different bottle, along with a card that said "To Mr. & Mrs. Chambers on your wedding night." Well, I feel sorry for Mr. & Mrs. Chambers, because they never got their champagne. We called the front desk and explained the issue to them, and they said they would have someone right up to make the switch. 45 minutes later, we still didn't have the right bottle. We didn't get it until someone from our group noticed our bottle sitting on the front desk and took it up to the room herself. And no one bothered to come up to the room to collect Mr. & Mrs. Chamber's bottle. Fast-forward. We were still getting ready in the room at 11 pm, and the roll-away bed hadn't arrived. That was fine, since we weren't ready for it yet, and I figured we'd have it by the time we were done partying at Ghostbar. Well, at 2:00 am the bed wasn't still there, so I called Whatever/Whenever and asked for the bed and some extra blankets and pillows. 20 minutes went by, and nothing, so I made another call. To make a long story short, it took 4 more phone calls, and finally, a trip down to the front desk just to get some extra pillows and blankets to appear, and by this time, it had been an hour since the first phone call. We were told that it was taking so long to get the pillows because they had to go to the 17th floor to get them. What, are they WALKING up 17 floors? Lask I checked, they had an elevator. And we still didn't have a roll-away bed. The people who brought the pillows and blankets told us that they didn't have any roll-away beds left. Another trip downstairs to the "night manager" accomplished nothing. This manager told us that he would have to verify that these people told us there were no more beds available. Well, if these people were lying about them not having any beds, then why didn't we ever get one?? The guy was completely clueless and wasn't able to help us in any way. And we never got the roll-away bed. A visit to the front desk in the morning found a much nicer, and much more capable manager. She seemed apalled at the way things had been handled, and reduced our room rate for us. This made things much better, but didn't change what had happened the night before. I think part of the issue with this hotel, is that the majority of the staff is inexperienced and young. And when I say young, I mean 18 to early twenties. It just felt like no one was really in charge, and no one knew what to do. I'm very torn as to whether I'd stay here again...The hotel is worth checking out if you can deal with the unreliable service.
UR5614026	I have stayed at W's through out the states. I have loved every experience with the W until I stayed at the W in Dallas. I was staying at the W for my three year anniversary, and thought the W would be perfect due to past experiences. I have to say that from the moment we stepped foot in the door the night was focused on standing at the front desk due to problem after problem, and not on each other. When addressing one of the many problems that we had, WE were looked at in disgust (as if we had done something wrong, or the "How dare you we are the W!"). Save yourself the trouble (like waiting 20 min. to get your car from valet, or save yourself 30 min to even get to the valet due to congestion outside the hotel)! Oh, and valet is the very least of your worries! The Ghostbar is one of the main hits at the W, if you are a guest you are not promised to get in (even after you have payed). We bought a package on the W website, which we thought would be fufilled, but it is sad to say that we received one out of the five features in the package, and were not reimbursed. We were simply shrugged off when each problem was addressed. I personally am appalled by the W's behavior. Not worth what you pay!
UR5594738	Just stayed there for business last week and thought the hotel and rooms were great, and I especially like chilling out at the pool during some down time. What was really cool was was the sceen at the hotel, especially if you're single ;). There was always something happening in the lobby bar and their bar menu was actually really good. I went up to the GhostBar Friday night with some colleagues and I've never seen more beautiful women in one place. I'd say all in all a very successful trip! I'll be back for more.
UR5564519	Hotel is completeley overrated... valet and bellman were nice. but that is where it ended.. they do not know what they are doing here. don't care attitude.. craft was OK. Craft Steak in las vegas MUCH better... Ghostbar.. what a joke.. no dance floor, just a bunch of people standing around trying to look cool. can't sit a tables unless you want to buy a$300 bottle of liguor . a bunch of men in dark suits guarding the elevators, pretty stupid.. pool has no sun at all and very small..
UR126678401	I was there for 3 nights. Most front desk staffs did not seem to be helpful nor appear to be friendly except one (I think his name is Mike if I remember correctly, *very tall and thin*). He was ,mostly there around 3-11 p.m., very knowledgeable, extremely friendly and helpful. I was glad and lucky enough that he happened to be on duty when I needed help/recommendation a couple of times. When I had questions for other front desk staffs, they either told me they did not know or just not gonna offer any assistance. In addition, the housekeeping manager was very nice and helpful when I needed his assistance. Overall, the room was small but comfortable. At night, I often heard some noises from the trains but nothing too serious. The bathroom products (Ren) were nice. The hotel basically offered every thing you needed except a toothpaste and toothbrush. Also , there is no control over the volume of the shower other than the water temperature which is a minor inconvenience.
UR126599961	This is a nice place especially if you can get it for under $200. staff is very nice, location is close to tribeca, soho and downtown. trains are close by. room was clean, had a nice view with floor to ceiling windows. Room is average size for this type of price range in NYC. You may want to stay on an upper floor because on floor 2 i could hear the people in the bar on the first floor.
UR125357965	We stayed in Duane Street Hotel for 3 nights in Feb 2012. We loved the hotel and the location. The rooms are clean, comfortable with all amenities and were actually bigger than expected! (New York hotel rooms are small! Get used to it!). We did not find the hotel at all noisy and got a great nights sleep in the super large and comfy bed. The staff are really friendly and full of usefull info. We ate in metaphor one night and the food was lovely. As a couple consisting of one vegetarian and one carnivourous coeliac we are quite hard to cater for but the restuarant provided a 5 course taster menu that met both of our dietary needs and was really tasty. Next time we visit New York we'll be back to Duane Street!
UR124966644	Most responsive staff I have ever met. Needed more hangars ... we had them in 3 minutes. Went down to ask about ice ... housekeeping was waiting with a bucket of ice for me when I went back to my room. I don't know how they beat me back! Wanted to make reservations for the 9/11 memorial ... Chris sat me down behind the computer at the front desk, walked me thru the process, and printed out the reservations. Super location ... easy walk to ground zero, Battery Park, financial district, city hall, Brooklyn Bridge, many great neighborhood restaurants. Only negative was that the room was small; although I've been in smaller. And, to be fair, I chose the smaller room to fit our budget. On the otherhand, despite the fact that we were on the second floor, facing busy Church Street, it was the quietest urban hotel I've ever been in. No noise ... really!!! ... from the restaurant below, the room above, the street (the windows were double-paned) or the hall. I was amazed!
UR124650793	Stayed here on a recent business trip to NYC and found it very comfortable. Located in the trendy TriBeCa area it is great for access to lower Manhatten as well as Greenwich Village and Soho. Beds and pillows were very comfortable, wall mounted flat screen TV, free wi-fi (!!) nice bathroom toiletries, and great walk-in roomy shower. Room was on small side (no place for luggage access), but that is usual in small boutique hotels. Very friendly service and vibe in the small ground floor lounge where they will serve you drinks. There is a very good restaurant on site, although I confess I didn't use it as breakfast is one of my favourite meals to have out in NYC. I would definitely go back. Perfect for business.
UR124541745	I stayed at the hotel for one week during a recent business trip to New York and was blown away by the level of service provided by everyone, from the manager down to those tasked with cleaning the rooms. We were given a larger room to accomodate printers and boxes of documents we had with us, at no charge. They brought a mini-regrigerator and replaced the normal desk chair with a high quality office chair because they knew we were using the room as an office as well as a place to sleep at night. The hotel is conveniently placed around great restaurants, deli, and was within walking distance to the courts in New York as well as the 9/11 memorial. I would certainly stay here again, on business and pleasure. Only down side of the hotel was that the rooms are not very soundproof and bad neighbors could make for some annoyance, though I'm confident the staff would handle any potential issue that may arise with professionalism and courtesy.
UR123863712	We just got home from a fun filled weekend in New York. The staff here made our stay a great one. They were so accomadating and helpful with all of our requests. They really went the extra mike in making recomendations on restaurants, bars and breakfast nooks. The restaurant here was awesome as well. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance from the most trendy places of all types. We will definately be staying here again.
UR123464326	If you're looking for a good night's sleep you won't get it here. You hear everything, and I mean everything in these rooms. The staff was helpful at reception and the restaurant and that may have been the only highlight here. The place has very tight corridors and overall not a very spacious hotel. Do try the restaurant however ( Metaphor ) great food!
UR121663614	I have been here twice and really enjoy this place. The rooms are simple, clean, and fresh looking with a spring green and white color palette. The staff was friendly and you can't beat the convenience of the location.
UR120898180	Had a great stay at the Duane Street hotel - the Staff were incredibly helpful and did everything in their powers to help with whatever was asked of them. First class. However.... As with all NY hotels, the rooms are small, so if it's your first time in NY, be prepared - don't even think of bringing a cat to swing! We stayed on the top floor (6th) in room 607 - not sure if this is a probelem with all rooms but I did notice we got a lot of cooking smells coming through the A/C, presumably from the Kitchens downstairs. Not totally unpleasant, but enough of a smell to notice, if you see what I mean. Towels - on two seperate days, the towels left in the bathroom were so old and tatty that one of them actually ripped when I was drying my back. I mean Guys, come on, this is the sort of thing you expect in a 1970's Seaside B&B, not a $400 per night boutique hotel! Those things aside, it's a great hotel, really well situated for the nightlife, shops and restaurants that tribeca is noted for.
UR120043128	Loved this little gem in the city! Stayed at the Duane for a week-end in the city with my 22 year old daughter in November. The two Michael's at the front desk couldn't have been more accommodating with tips for restaurants and offers to make the reservation to downloading Boggle on the hotel IPAD for us to use. Baked goods with orange water every day in the lobby. Free passes to the Equinox gym 4 blocks away. Rooms are small but cozy but we were hardly in the room. Our executive suite was on the second floor with lots of floor to ceiling windows. Room was clean with nice linens. And close to Soho, subway lines, and lots of restaurants and shopping. Will stay here again.
UR119930952	Have stayed at the Duane Street Hotel twice now and will most definitely do so again. I meet my sister in NYC each year for a long weekend and this place is perfect -- price, location, amenities. If you aren't looking to spend the majority of your shopping budget on accommodation, then this hotel is for you. Yes, rooms are small but they are also clean, stylish and pleasant and the little bar area has a nice buzz to it. All the staff are lovely too.
UR119829697	The manager was extremely accommodating in regards to my requesrpt for a late check out and amending the check out date with overriding the penalty fee since the hotel was relatively not busy. The location is great with plenty of stylish and good restaurants and bars in the vicinity without hoards of tourists and the bridge and tunnel crowd unlike, for say, the MPD. The only down fall, I would say, of this hotel is that I was deprived of sleep due to constant noise of the subway running right beneath.
UR119443726	Despite the pleasant and helpful staff, I can't recommend this place. The room was tiny! There was about fifteen inches of clearance between the wall and the bed on each side. I made the mistake of opening the closet while sitting on the bed, in an effort to open the safe, and found out I could not close the closest without sliding across the bed and walking around it. The single bed side lamp and and the other furnishings all are in the IKEA catalog. If I had been transported across the river in my sleep, I would have known I was in the store only by the extra size of the room. The bathroom was interesting at best. Only those limber enough to qualify for the Cirque du Soleil need attempt to reach the toilet paper from the sitting position.
UR119126890	I had an amazing one night layover stay at the Duane Street Hotel. The staff knew I was expected to have a 10pm check in and an early check out. They made the experience perfect. With a line up of restaurant within walking distance to the hotel or stay in and have drink in their cozy corner bar, a great place to set the bags down and relax. Very modern and clean. Upon entering the hotel, you know you are in for a treat. Their bar, restaurant and reception shares the main floor. I especially love the community dinning table and art books & artwork in the lobby. Great beds and quite reasonable for their location. The room was much larger than I was expecting. Great access to electrical plugs and tons of them to recharge all the electronics. When I head back to NYC, I will for sure stay at Duane Street Hotel...hopefully the stay will be a wee bit longer than the 9 hours on this trip.
UR119004002	The guy staffing the front desk was very helpful in getting me situated and recommend a few nice options for dinner. He was very informed about the neighborhood. The rooms are modern but not in an overly trendy way, more in a clean practical way. Unlike most mid priced hotels in New York, I did not feel cramped at all. Good high speed internet. Great area. In the morning the staff was so helpful in directing me to places where I could do my errands. I really have a problem with front desk staff in NYC sometimes being rude or uninformed, not the case here. Good job Guys!
UR118943464	I stayed at the Duane with a friend in a Superior King room. It's a boutique hotel, and was a decent value overall for a peak weekend in NYC in a good location close to lower Manhattan and SoHo/Village. It was very clean and our 6th floor room was quiet (with the exception of our neighbor slamming the door to their room occasionally). Others have commented on the subway rumbling; I'm a very light sleeper, and was not bothered by it. I've been to NYC several times, so expected a small room, and that's certainly what we got. However, the space planning could be better. They should consider replacing the (quite comfortable) king bed with a queen or nixing the platform that takes up several inches of prime real estate (and has very sharp corners). My friend and I bonded while getting ready in the tiny bathroom, and would have appreciated another mirror in the room itself. There was only one outlet (in the bathroom) so we had to move furniture to access others. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the restaurant seemed popular both Friday and Saturday nights.
UR117702099	We stayed here for 4 nights back in Oct 2010. We had spent a long time trying to find the best deal before we want, as Manhattan hotels can be expensive. We had originally earmarked some hotels in Jersey City that we were going to stay in, and then at the last minute found this hotel We loved the fact it wasn't in the centre, and we found the location to be perfect. We enjoy walking and walked into the centre each day. It was also close by for the WTC, Wall Street and the ferries to the Statue of Liberty, so all in all, a great location we thought. The rooms were small, but we didn't spend too much time in it to be honest It ticked all the boxes for us, and we would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of staying in NYC
UR116855659	I stayed for two nights on a business trip. This hotel was closest to the office I had to visit and that was my initial reason for chosing it. The room was small but had everything I needed and more...comfy bathrobe, very modern bathroom, and oh so very comfy bed and pillows. The air conditioner worked perfectly even in the August heat. The room was clean when I got there and housekeeping did a good job keeping it that way. The folks at the front desk were very helpful with suggestions on sights to see and a great map of Manhattan. The hotel is easily within walking distance to the World Trade Center, Battery Park and ferries to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. The walk to the Intrepid Museum is a little longer but doable. Trains were available but I preferred to walk which also gave me an opportunity to window shop and wander through the lovely parks along the river. I had dinner both nights at Metaphor...the restaurant located on the ground floor of the hotel. They feature small plates and I thought the prices were reasonable for food and drinks.
UR116787079	I would recommend the Duane Street Hotel to anybody needing a simple but chic, clean and quiet place to stay in Tribeca. Upon arrival, the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating of our particular needs, which involved storing large amounts of luggage even though it wouldn't fit in the luggage room. Our fifth-floor room was the quietest I have ever experienced in New York, and despite having a window onto the street below, there was no traffic noise whatsoever. It was relatively small, but tastefully appointed and unfussy with a wooden floor and crisp white bed linen. Not a cheap hotel, we managed to book at a reduced rate, so look out for internet deals.
UR116003516	The Duane is a very comfortable and trendy hotel, just down the road from Ground Zero. The rooms are very small, but well designed and comfortable. The concierge staff were terrific, and the hotel is close to several subway lines. They have a nice bar as well. Great access to a large, clean gym just around the corner
UR115999693	We had a great stay. While the room was on the small size, the big was a King and the bathroom was a really good size. Great location. We also enjoyed our meal and drinks in the bar and restaurant.. It had a really good vibe especially on the weekend.
UR115185426	The limited number of rooms makes the hotel nice, friendly and personal. Good service from all staff, restaurant food was good and nice atmosphere in the bar. Room clean, modern and tasteful, bathroom very nice. What else can I say just a great all-round stay.
UR115089517	Having stayed at 5-star hotels throughout the world I can tell you that this hotel competes with them for service. I think the front desk staff memorizes the name of every guest in the hotel. They are very friendly and accomodating and our concierge was one of the best. The level of service is on par with any hotel, anywhere. If I have anything to say about it our group will stay here every year for our training sessions.
UR115070817	I stayed here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The staff were friendly and the service was excellent. The rooms are modern, comfortable, well appointed and quite roomy for NYC. The location is very good, close to the Broadway shopping district, the financial district and within walking distance to Soho and the Village. There is an excellent gym with free access from the hotel a block away and plenty of nearby cafes, bars and restaurants.
UR115022384	I would say GOOD as opposed to Very Good. We had a room with two queen beds, which were comfortable for our family (2 adults, 2 kids 10 and 13). We enjoyed the area - residential and convenient to subways. However, if your trip is more centered to Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, definitely stay farther north. Not many extras here except good cookies in the evening which we did enjoy. Seems kid friendly from website but not much space for them to hang out a bit - sitting area is next to the small bar. . . I think couples would enjoy more.
UR114913682	The hotel is a block from a friend's apartment so we decided to give a go to avoid the cab ride home after a party. The rooms are super Manhattan small, and there is no fridge in the rooms - as there is nowhere to put one! We were in an 'Executive King' but the bathroom was so small that it did make us wonder how small a real queen would have to be to fit in the bathroom at all! The bed has sharp wooden corners which you WILL hit your shin on as the room is too small to walk around the bed without doing so. On the plus side the staff were very helpful when I needed emergency dry cleaning and pressing of a suit, and the shoe shine they organised for my old brown brogues was stunning. In all honesty the downstairs bar and restaurant is a bit smaller than the impression you'd get from the website - this is a small hotel. But if you want to be in the heart of Tribeca and stay somewhere quiet, friendly and discreet this might be for you...
UR109789250	My husband and I spent one week there in may 11. The hotel is great: room is large, shower very big, great internet connection and very kind stuff. I'd go there again next time!
UR109732262	small rooms, but comfortable, quiet, clean with all the amenities. The location is great to walk to everything in lower Manhattan and close to the subway. Can't beat that on a short trip.
UR108628540	I had never heard of Duane Street Hotel before. I made a reservation through Magellan Vacations. I was looking for something in lower Manhattan because we had already toured upper and midtown area earlier in the week. Duane Street is perfectly located in Tribeca off a quite street but within waling distance of Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown and the Financial District. I felt very comfortable and safe at this hotel. It is not flashy and does not come with a chocolate on your pillow but we did not come to sit in a hotel during our visit to NYC. Duane Street Hotel was cozy and cooperative with all our needs. Elvin, the front desk concierge, gave us great maps and recommendations. Make sure you visit Petite Abeille for some fantastic Belgian fare.
UR106443369	We generally enjoyed our stay at the Duane Street Hotel. Our room was acceptable. We found the service to be generally quite good, other than at breakfast, which was not satisfactory. Our room was a bit noisy. We also had to close the shades because people walking by on the street could see in the room (we were given a room on a low floor).
UR103521953	Iâ€™ve been studying tripadvisor for the past several months planning a trip to Asia. Iâ€™ve often wondered about the reliability of the hotel reviews on this site, given that the same property can get a wide range of reviews. Can a proprietor sign in and give himself a glowing review? Can a competitor sign in and trash the competition? So, as a comparison, I thought Iâ€™d look at the reviews of the Duane Street Hotel in New York. Iâ€™ve stayed at this property about a dozen times over the past 18 months, while traveling for work. I was amazed to find that 19 of 88 reviewers rated this hotel as â€œpoorâ€� or â€œterrible.â€� Iâ€™ve found the Duane Street to be an excellent hotel. The rooms are small but clean and well appointed. The staff is friendly, professional and helpful. The location is perfect for my purposes, because I can walk to my meetings. Tribeca is an interesting neighborhood, and you are just a few blocks from Ground Zero and St. Paulâ€™s Chapel. The beds are extremely comfortable, and in my experience the heating and cooling are easy to operate and work well. Yes, there is some street noise, but I find the rooms to be remarkably quiet given that you are 3, 4 or 5 stories above a fairly busy street in Manhattan. Street noise has woken me up a couple of times, but that can happen anywhere. I think being just a few stories above Church Street gives you a sense of scale and a feel for the city. Iâ€™m still left wondering how useful this site is. If I saw a hotel that had more that 20% of its reviews rating it as â€œpoorâ€� or â€œterrible,â€� Iâ€™d stay away. If I did that in this case, I would have missed out on a great hotel. If you read through the negative reviews, common themes are small rooms, street noise and poor service, my experience on those fronts is addressed above. There are some one off situations â€“ like the guy who had the building fire alarm go off while he was in the shower. Other complaints raise real questions about the reviewers themselves â€“ how long was that guy planning to store two dozen boxes of cupcakes in his hotel room? Does anyone really store large quantities of cash in a hotel room? Can all of these stories be true? The attitudes, preferences and expectations of the traveler play a large role in their experience of a hotel. Ultimately the reviews on this site may tell us more about the reviewers than the hotels themselves.
UR101090251	Stayed here with a best friend. Loved everything about the hotel: clean, airy rooms that, while not huge, are fresh and perfectly-appointed--and have wood floors...no skeevy carpeting to tiptoe across! Fabulous, arty colors on all of the walls--even the hallways are cool. Everyone we dealt with was helpful, friendly, easy-going. The whole vibe was chill and relaxing, but not lax. We had appetizers and wine in the lobby/Metaphor restaurant. Felt like we were in a friend's living room; our wine glasses were constantly topped off, and the food was really delicious. The area is without parallel: great people-watching, boutique-bopping, crazy-great restaurant options. I will beeline it back to the Duane!
UR96571953	Very clean hotel. Hardwood floors instead of questionably clean carpet. Small but efficient room. Comfortable bed with pristine white bedding. Friendly and helpful but unobtrusive staff. Nice, relatively quiet neighborhood with good restaurants. Near the subway and easy to grab a cab.
UR96273254	I stayed at the Duane St. Hotel while i was in town for some business meetings. Since it is in Tribeca it was a little inconvenient for some of my midtown meetings but it is convenient to subway and i never had trouble getting a taxi. The room was small (aren't they all in the city), but always clean and nicely decorated. Bar and restaurant attracted cool people, and was fun. i had the opportunity to stay an extra two days because of a blizzard and canceled flights and the desk was very helpful and I wound up having a great time and enjoying the city and neighborhood in the snow.
UR93755354	We (hubby, 3 yr old, & I) were looking for a weekend NYC getaway & choose to stay at the Duane Street hotel per a Cyber Monday deal I'd found. While it was very small (I've stayed in similar small rooms closer to Times Square), it was very clean & welcoming. Upon check-in, we were informed of books available for check out for our little one, which was a first. Our room was nicely painted, bright, & made practical use of the space available. At first, we thought it was quiet, but upon returning at night, were surprised that it has a bit of nightlife (trendy & upscale crowd). We would've sat & had a drink had we not had the little one with us. In the morning, we were able to walk to the World Trade Center, which is just a few blocks away. All in all, I'd recommend this small gem of a hotel!
UR91997553	We paid nearly US$600 a night for what is a very ordinary hotel. i am stunned to see others received turn down service, a newspaper, breakfast - we did not receive any of these. In 30 years of travelling absolutely the worst value hotel i have ever stayed in, anywhere on the planet. the windows were very dirty - not cleaned for a long time. the aircon was incredibly noisy. the first room we were shown was microscopic - eventually given a room where you could at least get the suitcases in. the bed is badly designed with a sharp edge that protudes - both hurt our legs, and also a very saggy experience to sleep on. the shower produced a miniscule dribble. VERY NOISY from traffic - hard to sleep. Staff would shout and argue very loudly in corridors at all hours - were woken several times a night. view of run down buildings outside. the front desk staff were all young, some quite aggressive, and mostly unghelpful. would not call a taxi on departure - waved us to the street where we stood for nearly 45 minutes in vain. it was so uncomfortable and so expensive for so little, we decamped to the Royalton mid town, paid $150 LESS per night and got full 5 star service, great room, great staff, and CLEAN. I would not pay any more than $150 per night for this dump. not only overpriced, but actually was so unpleasant we had to move. Had booked 3 days. After first horrible night they insisted that if we checked out they would charge us at least for two nights, even if we stayed one - they would charge my credit card regardless. Forced to stay two nights. Made it clear that we were not happy with the poor condition of the hotel, but staff did not care. emailed management, never had a reply
UR91634695	Impossible to sleep, constant noise from heater, street cars, shaking from the metro down, no air so small is the room, no space at all even to put luggages, no views, curtains didn't close light, no sound insulation, shower was small and wAter flooding the toilet, odd noises coming from street and neighbors, room too hot an tv wasn't working, price for standard room in low season 230 dollars. just can't sleep no matter how tires you are
UR84787381	A great little hotel with very competitive room rates. Some might find the rooms a little on the small side but, from my experience, most rooms in New York tend to be on the small side. Myself and my husband visited with two other couples who were also very impressed with the hotel. The location might not be central enough for everyone but there is an subway station about 300 yards from the hotel which takes you to Times Square in about 10 minutes.
UR82721987	We were really looking forward to our trip to NYC and were expecting a small room. But this was ridiculous! The camera used to take the photos on the internet must have had magical powers as we felt really deceived. There was barely enough room to walk around the bed. We had to take special care when doing so as well because the corners of the beds were like deadly weapons. I still have the bruises to prove it. When we first checked in I asked the girl at the desk what the possibility of an upgraded room would be. Instead of politely turning us down she just gigled and brushed my question off. I never did get an answer. The aircon in this room was diabolical! All was OK until the thermostat clicked in and decided the room was getting too warm. Then the blast of cold (and loud) air was shot out. It got to the point that during the night I started to dread the sound of the clicking thermostat. Then when the blast of cold air was finished, the sound of silence was almost deafening. The staff were OK, not overly helpful, but adequate. It would have been nice to get some room service other than breakfast (only after 7am). The fixtures in the bathroom (towel and toilet roll holder) were continually snapping away from the wall and were shoddily repaired. Overall, we liked the location of this hotel as Tribeca is away from the hustle and bustle, but still close enough to get to when you wanted some action.
UR80635092	stayed at hotel 7 nights as a part of a honeymoon...we were delighted with the room and with the staff...location was great if u want to get a good night sleep after walking all day long on the streets of ny... room was very nice designed, great cleaned everyday, very modern and urban, a boutique hotel...we loved it and will return there for sure...staff was very nice to us, helped us alot with whatever we needed and the price for the room was cheap comparing what we got in return... 146 $ a night, 2 persons ( but we booked it 6 months before coming to ny ) all in all great hotel
UR78552165	my husband and i used to live in tribeca, so we picked this hotel based on its location. i read a couple reviews saying the service wasn't great, but i took them with a grain of salt and decided to try the place for myself. the room was nice, small - but that's expected, comfortable bed, good bathroom. the service was pretty appalling. i am very easygoing and it takes a lot for me to get annoyed, but almost every encounter i had with the front desk staff was ridiculous. i've never been told "no" at a hotel when making a completely reasonable request (asking for a cot at 6pm on a saturday evening, when i had already called in advance to reserve it). i accepted the "no" and moved on - i said i would still like the cot for the next night. sunday night comes...no cot. no mention of it, no apology, no asking if housekeeping brought it, no nothing. for the same money i would rather stay at tribeca grand, have staff that actually cares about making their guests happy, and not have a bus stop 5 feet from my window.
UR75825591	Superb location centrally in Tribeca. Relaxed atmosphere, clean and complete rooms.
UR75561126	We stayed three nights in a room on the top floor. Like most hotel rooms in New York it was small, but very well designed and was light, airy, very clean and modern. We had been warned about street noise, but as far as we found the double glazing worked well, also perhaps because it was on the 6th floor, noise from the subway was minimal - after all, this is New York! The only downside was the air conditioning unit kept us awake for three nights, so much so that on the third night we had to switch it off, luckily the weather had just gotten cooler. It was incredibly noisy and would 'blast' out cold air every 8 minutes. Upon checking out, no real apologies or even an attitude of caring when feeding back, despite when after the first night we had asked if something could be done to change the way it operated. For that reason, we wouldn't stay again, because for the price you pay, a problem as described above should really be dealt with in a more professional manner.
UR72480796	The Duane Street Hotel was so comfortable....GREAT bed. The staff was really helpful and friendly. I normally stay in Midtown but I just LOVED Tribeca. It was relaxed and "neighborhoody". I will certainly stay at the Duane Street again
UR71199557	We found a great deal for Fourth of July Weekend at www.bookit.com with this hotel ($105/night). We lived in New York before so when we saw the location which is TRIBECA, we knew we hit the jackpot! The subway (C,E) are right around the corner from the hotel. When you walk into the lobby, you will be greeted by Lessie who has the biggest smile in the world. A cool container or fruit infused water awaits us and freshly baked cookies and mini desserts in the counter. Our room was in the 4th floor and we learned that each room has a view of the city. Elevators were fast and good music. The room was clean and has floor to ceiling glass window which we loved. The it has a sheer curtain with an additional shade screen to trap the light for late sleepers. The queen size bed was comfy with it bright white fluffy comforter. Flat screen TV and a desk was appropriately situated. The room is the average size NYC room. For those who found this room small, they haven't lived in the city where space is a luxury! This is not Kansas! The room also included an iron which big hotel chains don't even include. I even had a fridge delivered in the room to keep our store bought water bottles. The bathroom was adequately stocked with organic amenities. The rain shower was comforting after a long day of walking! LOCATION::: it is is close to Broadway which is lined with stores to shop. Chinatown and Little Italy is less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There are tons of restaurants around the hotel that stay open late. We didn't eat at Beca but the place looks very nice. Would definitely stay in this hotel again!!!
UR69772771	I was very pleased with my stay at the Duane Street Hotel. My partner had been there before and she highly recommended it. I'm very glad she did. The location in Tribeca is very convenient for exploring downtown. If you like to walk, it's a great base for exploring the Village, Soho, Little Italy and venturing into the Lower East Side. The neighbourhood has much more character than anything in Midtown and the subway is nearby any time you want to head uptown. As noted by others, the rooms are not large but they are extremely well-appointed, comfortable and have very high ceilings. (although I believe one of the floors has lower ceilings than the others so you might want to ask when booking) For the excellent price we paid, I could not have imagined more from a room. The value was exceptional. Yes, sometimes you can hear the subway or a bit of street life -- but, after all, this IS NEW YORK CITY! If you want total peace and quiet go somewhere else. The sound is minor; we didn't lose a wink of sleep during our stay. The desk staff was always extremely friendly and very accommodating. When the concierge overheard us talking about dead batteries in a camera, she immediately went to the cabinet behind her and with a smile offered us some double-A's from the hotel's stash. There is always fresh fruit or fresh baked treats beautifully displayed at the front desk for anyone to enjoy and a big pitcher of cool fresh water, flavoured by pieces of orange or apple. Small, personal touches like this say a lot about a place. I'm very happy to have a "go-to" hotel in New York for my visits in the future.
UR69702698	From what I saw the size of the rooms varies, but ours was incredibly small. It fits a queen size bed (smaller than usual), a couple of bed side drawers, and about enough room for one person between the bed and the walls. That said, the rooms and bathroom were very clean and fitted to a very high quality. Service was very good and friendly. Good location - tribeca has some great bars and restaurants, and the subway is a short walk away. The only other thing to say is that I was on the second floor and had all the noise of the busy church street outside. You can hear every subway train and it usually shakes the room a bit too. I live in central london so I'm used to putting up with plenty of noise outside, but this was too much at times. We had to wear eyemasks and earplugs at night, which made it fine.
UR69545659	We stayed here for a week as a family with teenage children, all sharing a room. The room was extremely stylish and well equipped, if a little on the snug side for four people, but that was our doing not theirs. It would have been very roomy for just two. The hotel had been refurbished fairly recently and had undergone a name change, taking it more into 'boutique' territory. The lobby area was again simply stylish, like the room, but extremely small, as are the restaurant and bar, which both sit along side it. Consequently, accompanying facilities were fairly limited - staff were helpful and friendly. The location, in Tribeca, is a little off the beaten path so it tends to be very quiet at night and at weekends. There is also a limited choice of restaurants close by - especially if you want something family friendly, as they tend to be quite up market and pricey. Dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant were expensive alternatives. We enjoyed our stay, but felt that the price was on the high side considering the overall lack of space in the common areas and limited general facilities.
UR67787148	Loved the loaction of this hotel in Tribeca just minutes from the subway so you can get uptown very quickly but evening thing you need is on your doorstep. Hotel was spotless the rooms are small but well formed and the bed was heaven. Staff really friendly. I will stay again next time I'm in New York. There is free use of a computer and printer in the Reception area which was great to checkin and print boarding cards for flight home.
UR66484854	QUALIFIED RECOMMENDATION: This property is located far downtown, not in a neighbor and thus has limited restaurant choices. The subway is directly below the building and your room might well rumble with each passing train. Rooms are brightly furnished and big windows but not much room to move about in. Bathroom is small but nicely equipped and in a modern style. Staff was friendly and it's a small and well maintained property. The good news is downtown is quieter on the weekends and a late night cab fare from even mid-town is only $10-12. This wouldn't likely be MY first choice for a NY visit but you can clearly do worse.
UR66102861	I stayed here for two nights with my husband. I woke up with 5 huge bit marks in a row on my left leg and was scraching it all day. After showing my doctor because it was all swollen, he determined it to be bed bugs. Absolutely disgusting. I still have bright red marks all down my leg. It's summer and I can't even wear shorts now. This place should be shut down.
UR64785987	My colleagues and I use this hotel frequently. It is consistently cheaper and better than other "boutique" hotels in New York. Personally I find the whole boutique/trendy hotel thing a scam to charge high prices, with crap service, just because your decor is modern but... this place is clean, the wifi is free (it irks me that hotels charge atop $200 rates) and the rooms are small but no smaller than most. Higher floors don't get much noise and I don't mind the little noise that hits the lower floors. The staff have always been fine for me. We get decent corporate rates so if you can get a deal it's good value. Only negative is breakfast - expensive and usually incredibly slow.
UR59182098	This hotel is an unmitigated disaster, a perfect example of the boutique hotel gone wrong. The unfriendly, unhelpful desk clerk was the highlight of my one night stay. The biggest problem at the Duane Street Hotel is that every room faces Church Street, which is a busy thoroughfare in lower Manhattan. There is no escape from the traffic noise associated with it. Despite assurances from the hotel that the rooms had double glazed windows, it made absolutely no difference. All day, all night long all you could hear was cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, sirens, etc. It was impossible to sleep and there was nowhere to escape. So if you like street noise, this is your place. If you are a light sleeper, best to look elsewhere. The room was cramped, closet tiny. The bed however was comfortable and the free wireless worked well. No chance I would return for any price.
UR58629523	Our room faced the street, but we couldn't hear any traffic. The bathroom was modern, the bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of dressers and space for clothing. The room was small, which was expected. Everything worked well and it was super clean, with a white duvet on the bed and hardwood floor. The staff were friendly, a plate of home baked cookies were on the desk each day for an afternoon treat. The room rate included continental breakfast (if you're a coffee drinker you get a whole pot of pressed coffee). It also included a great gym less than 2 blocks away. The gym was new and clean and had every kind of equipment you could want. Two subway stations are within 2 blocks of the hotel.
UR58194427	Very warm welcome upon arrival, was given relevant and interesting information on nearby cafes, restarants and shops by reception staff at their own initiative. Clean and functional room, with a personal touch. Extremely good location in quiet neigbourhood with lots of good restaurants, small shops etc. Close to subway with good connections uptown. Fast and stable wifi. Some maintenance drag, modest common areas - not very tempting for breakfast etc at hotel but not a problem as staff can direct you to excellent alternatives nearby. Also on the positive side; the hotel has a deal with a nearby gym, so even though there is no gym at the actual hotel you can get a great workout just down the street. To those complaining about noise from subway etc I totally disagree. Sure, you can notice the subway if your mindset is all about finding negative aspects of a good experience, but if you are so sensitive to noise I would suggest a different destination all together or at least bring some earplugs ;) For us it worked out perfectly
UR57002356	Like spending six nights in the 7th layer of hell. We dreaded returning to this hotel every night. We actually had to take sleeping pills each night to try and sleep through the night. In February, the room was a steady 90 degrees, all day and all night. I cannot imagine what temperatures it rises to in the summer!! When we complained, we were told that air conditioning was not available during the winter and to try turning off our heat. We never had the heat on to begin with!! We spent every waking moment in the room naked with the lights off trying not to stir up any extra energy to cause heat. We woke up drenched in sweat every morning (that is, if we were able to sleep). The bed itself only had a topsheet, so it moved and we were exposed to the mattress anytime we slept in it, and when I asked the maid about it she replied that she didn't have any other type of sheet. They did not offer to move us after our second complaint, and we obviously should have left. A horrible situation, we frequently visit NY to see family and this was the worst experience at a hotel we have ever had. SKIP IT. We we on the 2nd floor, room was very clean, decent size. The staff are extremely friendly. Great location, close to subway, restaurants.
UR56990999	The hotel is in a wonderful location downtown 3 blocks from SoHo. A few of the bad things with the hotel: No parking garage, A little worn out, every 10 minutes or so you can hear the subway and the floor vibrates. It's a do it yourself type of hotel you must go downstairs to the restaurant in order to get ice. The positives of the hotel are: Location, Cleanliness, Big Bathroom, the staff although sparce is friendly. This place will do if you know your way around the city and don't mind doing everything on your own.
UR51508887	We stayed at the Duane Street Hotel for a weekend in December. It's well located in Tribeca close to SoHo. Chambers subway station is around the corner. The staff was friendly, relax and helpful. This hotel is new and modern and the rooms have a great design especially the bathroom. The bed and pillows are very comfortable! The negative point goes to the size: tiny! It was hard for to 2 adults to move around without bumping into each other. Breakfast in the morning was good, consider choosing the package room + breakfast because the prices are high. WiFi worked well. We had a great time in NY and I would probably choose this place again.
UR51401787	as a former new yorker who now only comes to visit, manhattan hotels are a new experience for me. Having stayed at Gild Hall, Sofitel, Smyth and Renaissance 57, Duane Street was a drastic departue but gave me exactly waht i was looking for. the rooms were clean but tiny, and that was reflected in the price! windows were thin & allowed for a draft and street noise (again, not entirely unexpected), and the door to the hall was very thin & gave the impression of every passerby being in your room (being right next to the elevator didnt help) ... but again, what do yuo expect for $220/night. Location was great & very convenient to the subway, while avoiding the mmidtown tourists. staff was unhelpful & not very poised, but i had no expectations of anything more. This hotel is for those who know what they are doing & where they are going in new york, but just need a base of operations ... but be advised that rooms are almost too small for a couple.
UR50415614	Excellant hotel in every aspect, size of room, spotless clean, modern, everything worked! Anna on reception was a star other girls nice but not as chatty Try the Ninja restaurant on hudson street you wont be disappointed and try the chicken wings from Mudville 9 again just around corner. Close to subway and loads of bars we liked Ward 111 great personal service from the guys. If you go to NY a personal tour from REAL NEW YORK TOURS is a must
UR43189902	Well.... We went to NYC for a fun weekend adventure and we got a little bit more than we bargained for. Aside from my wife being convinced a camera crew would pop up to tell us we were on "Reality Hell" (google it), we sure had much of the adventure we were looking for. We checked in and dropped off our bags earlier in the day and when we returned around 11pm to pick up the keys, everything was fine. The girl at the front desk was the sweetest thing, Ana, was her name (same as my daughter), she engaged into a delightful conversation while she handled our questions about the city and made us keys. She assured us if there was anything we needed to better our stay, do not hesitate to contact her directly. That made my wife happy, which is all that matters. We decided to retire early and get ready for a busy saturday of sightseeing and our "Big City Adventure" that my wife prepared a scheduled itinerary, covering everything from time to sleep and shower to bathroom breaks and meals. Upon entering our Guest Room, my wife began unpacking her things. I, on the other hand, was scheduled to shower. After retrieving my pajamas, and headed into the beautiful shower, with minimal water pressure (not by choice), the fire alarm ruptured both of my eardrums with the echo in that bathroom. Of course, my wife calls the lady at the front desk to see "What's Wrong?" to find out they are not certain, but to be cautious we should come downstairs until further notice. She informed us the elevators were not working, to take the closest stairwell to the 1st floor. We found the closest stairwell and began to walk calmly down the stairs. Once we got to the lobby, there were about 3 fire trucks outside and about more fireman than you can imagine. The poor girl that gave us the keys was playing the role of SuperWoman. Making phone calls to management, calming down scared guests and handling all the requests of the firemen. She was real trooper, no joke, to the point that in the midst of all this chaos, one guest asked her from a room change. Surprisingly, her response to the guest was very calm and she informed her once things settled down, she would be more than happy to fulfill that request. If I was her, I would be singing a totally different tune. Turned out there was no fire in the hotel. We were not on any Fear Factor or Reality TV Show, which I think disappointed my wife. But we definately had the Big City Adventure, just not the one that was planned. We want to give alot of credit to the Front Desk Agent, who handled this event with the utmost professionalism and courtesy. She was the only person there and was able to multi-task without any guidance. She is truly an assest to this property. It was a scary situation for my wife and I, worrying if all of our things would be okay as we took nothing but a cell phone downstairs. I was wearing nothing but boxer shorts outside of the Duane Street Hotel. Other than that, I now see why New York City is the City that never sleeps, or was it Sin City? Either Way. The one thing that does worry me, although the Front Desk Agent handled everthing well, was if this was a real emergency. Duane Street Hotel is a Death Trap waiting to happen.
UR33277640	Chose the Duane Street Hotel as a flop in January while hanging out in NYC. Stayed on the 3rd floor. Room a good size, bath very nice, high-end bath products, most comfy bed we've ever slept on in a hotel, but then, we sleep on a futon at home, so take that for what its worth. 2 issues: you can hear the subway rumble underneath the bed EACH AND EVERY TIME it rolls thru the station, and we left our card out for a room-service breakfast; though it was gone in the AM our order never made it to the kitchen. Staff wasn't bothered in the least by the oversight. We had to call the order in and wait until almost check out to receive some cold eggs. Overall, not worth 3 fins.
UR32540803	It was our first time in NY and we really loved it. We specially picked this hotel because it hasn't got so much rooms. The rooms were big enough and the shower is great. When you leave your window open at night there's a lot of noise of the street. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. The hotel is ideally located in Lower Manhattan.
UR32249870	Nestled in the Tribeca area just below Canal Street is a very special upscale hotel with an outstanding, attentive, and hard working staff. Having stayed at many fine hotels in the City such as the Tribeca Grand, The Four Seasons, The Peninsula, The Palace, etc., I'm used to being spoiled, and used to great hotel locations. Interestingly I accidentally discovered this hotel, The Duane Street Hotel, a year ago during a two-week stay at the Tribeca Grand, wandering the neighborhood. At the time I asked the front desk if it would be possible for them to show me a sampling of their rooms and they were very gracious in doing so. I made it a point to put the Duane on my short-list for future trips. What stands out most is the high-quality professional staff. Each and every member of the staff, including the managers, front desk, housekeeping, dining, and maintenance, are friendly, experienced, caring, considerate, professional, and dedicated to providing the best possible guest experience possible. The [smaller] size of the hotel allows for personal service and attention which can easily get lost in the bigger hotels. There are no slackers here. Everyone is on their toes, consistently going out of their way to provide great service in a very timely manner. They are all to be commended for going the extra mile. Speaking of miles, this brings up yet another great benefit of the Duane. It's location. Convenience to SoHo, Tribeca, and the financial district, all by foot, the piÃ¨ces de rÃ©Â·sisÂ·tance is direct access within about one block of a multitude of trains [subways]. I live by the trains to get me where I want, fast, so it's important that my hotel be located fairly near major train access stations and the Duane, by no accident, is a dream come true with direct access to the A & C lines as well as the 1-2-3 lines. As if this is not strategic enough, just walk over another avenue cross-town to catch the Lexington Avenue trains at the Brooklyn Bridge City Hall Station for access to the 4-5-6! With such quick and easy access to all these major arteries one can travel by train to virtually any location in the City within minutes. Again, the best part of the Duane's location [in addition to being located in the desirable Tribeca area] is it's proximity to the subways, within just a few footsteps. In closing [I'm currently mid-stay during a two-week business trip] I am happy to recommend The Duane Street Hotel to anyone looking for value, location, amenities [yes, they even have thick-heavy bath robes], attention to detail, cleanliness, and most importantly a professional, gracious, and friendly staff. I look forward to re-booking future stays at The Duane. John Hay p.s. ......it's true about the beds. It's like sleeping on a cloud. Also, the rooms are extremely sound-proffed by what appear to be recently installed "duplicate-double-paned" dual sets of all the windows which practically eliminate street noise. Love the super-tall ceilings too. Great layout and design.
UR28774167	This hotel is lovely. The rooms are small, but for NYC that is quite the standard. The bed is amazing and so is the shower. Some noise from the street can be heard, so bring your ear plugs though. Highly recommended.
UR28415034	We had many problems at this attractive, small hotel in Tribeca. We had prepaid for our room ( 6 nights) but after a few nights they put a random $900 charge on our bill. They acknowledged the mistake but it was just luck that we caught the charge on our Visa card while we were still at the hotel. Every night we were lacking something in our room either towels or water glasses which were brought up after we called the desk but that was a nuisance. On the sixth day there we left at 7:30 and returned at 3:15 to find our room still not cleaned. Neither the desk clerks nor the housekeeper apologized. They tried to say we must have put out a Do Not Disturb sign. When that excuse didn't work they had several stories about being full that night, having to clean up rooms for new arrivals and finally the old "one of our housekeepers didn't show up for work" story. A simple apology would have gone a long way to placating us. We finally got into our cleaned room at 3:45.
UR28408450	Booked Duane St online, received confirmation, and paid in advance. Upon my arrival at the front desk, I was told that the hotel was "overbooked" and that I was being moved to another property. It just set a bad tone at what was supposed to be a long weekend break. I've traveled extensively for business and pleasure and have to say I was never told a hotel was overbooked. That's bad enough but waiting to be told when you arrive? Unacceptable. The attitude of the staff was akin to "Well, that's the breaks. Sorry".
UR27952961	Duane Street Hotel in the Tribeca area was ideally located in lower Manhattan, walking distance to major sites, such as, Century 21, the best department store shopping, but get there early esp on weekends, as it gets very hectic; ground zero is only like 10 minutes away right near Century 21; Battery Park, China Town, the Financial District, and restaurants are everywhere within walking distance. Our favorite place was Bouley's bakery and restaurant - plenty of sushi places, Indian, ethnic restaurants all nearby - the staff at Duane Street Hotel are very pleasant and they love doggies! I would definitely come back to this hotel, it's small but clean and cozy.
UR27578294	We also wanted to stay out of the midtown craziness and explore a new area of NYC. This hotel was amazing. The staff was helpful, the rooms were beautiful and the bed was more comfortable than ours at home. It is 1.5 blocks away from the subway and within walking distance to a lot. I would go back any time!
UR26267730	We spent 3 days here on a long weekend in NYC. Overall it's a very nice hotel. Our room was of course compact (It is NYC!), but it was well appointed and nicely kept. I enjoyed the hardwood floors especially. The services were quite good for a small hotel. There was nightly turndown with a tasty sweet treat and when we wanted to borrow a bottle opener for some beer we picked up at Whole Foods (very nearby) they grabbed us one from the bar no questions asked. One note though, there is no doorman which seemed odd for such a nice property. On the down side, the air handling unit was incredibly loud in our room and didn't work all that well. This was easily overcome though by the fact that the windows actually opened, so we simply turned the unit off altogether and enjoyed some fresh spring air!
UR25886555	I had a great experience there this past weekend. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and they have the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on at a hotel. Whatever renovations they did to reduce the noise pollution worked - we couldn't hear anything from the street or neighbors (at least in room 602). Really professional, non-pretentious and helpful staff. There are great Tribeca restaurants near by, we had dim sum in Chinatown, and walked all over lower Manhattan.I highly recommend it if you are looking for something away from the large corporate places.
UR24924085	It was serendipitous that my last business trip took me to Denver where I stayed at the Westinâ€™s new Aloft brand, which tries its best to pretend itâ€™s a trendy hotel in downtown New York City. If you read that review I took them to the woodshed because the room was so poorly designed. So how does a real NYC boutique hotel do in my opinion? Top notch of course. I checked in for one night on Feb. 8. The front desk and lobby are small but very well appointed. The front desk person is extremely pleasant and checked me in quickly. They invite you to sit down with them while you check in. Nice touch. Went to the room. Lo and behold its small, but not tiny. Big enough for a King bed. Beautifully decorated, very comfortable bed. The bathroom is large for the roomâ€™s size. Great toiletries and glassed in shower large enough to actually shower in. TV is large flat screen and in the corner of the room on a swivel arm so you can move it about depending on where you are sitting in the room. The clock radio is a Bose and is nicer than any of the audio equipment I have at home. Sounded like I had surround sound with six speakers. It was a quiet night in the hotel so I was the only person at the bar until friends arrived. Good bar selection for beer, but oddly no liquor license. Which was fine, I only wanted beer anyway. Shockingly low priced for NYC hotel. In all, THIS is what trendy hotels are supposed to be. Maybe the â€œpretendersâ€� from Aloft and other big name brands should spend a night or two here and learn how boutique hotels in NY are supposed to be designed. High marks from this person who will gladly return. Great stay
UR23661854	Stayed here for one night with my husband after finding a great deal on Travelzoo. We were greeted very warmly by staff, and we were offered hot cider on a freeeezing NYC day. The room was not large, but every inch of space was decorated very lovely and efficiently. There were many touches that you only find in the finest of hotels. The bed was comfortable, they left treats at turn down, filled the ice bucket and turned on soft music for our arrival. We had a complimentary buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant, which was nice. The only complaint would be the shower pressure was very low. All in all, a wonderful experience. Would stay again for sure.
UR22801758	My husband and I booked a quick weekend trip to NYC and found a great deal on this hotel on Travelzoo.com. I was a bit skeptical about staying so far from the Midtown theater scene, but this hotel was centrally located (less than 2 blocks) from the major subway lines. The neighborhood was charming, and the staff very helpful -- especially Melissa. We did venture to Midtown, but the crowds and noise were overwhelming. Small, but well appointed queen room (306) with nice views of the street below. Great amenities like NY Times, cookies at turndown, soft sheets, and high ceilings. We will definitely book again.
UR22683299	This is a very chic and trendy NEW property. The lobby and restaurant area are cozy, they even have a small bar. Unfortunately its only beer and wine which is quite over priced. I really don't think the staff understands that because I was given direction to a restaurant by a evening employee who reeked of hard liquor, through his broken slurred English. The front desk concierge was quite embarrished and made his best efforts to provide great service, but the unprofessional mannerism and drunken demeanor in the middle of the lobby was a bad reflection on a otherwise pleasant stay. There's an old saying that "one bad apple can spoil the bunch", that was the case here. Hopefully they will recruit more professional staff like the concierge Dan and the bellman Reegoo.
UR22519317	The Duane Street Hotel is a short walk from many attractions including China Town, Little Italy, the WTC and City Hall. A block away is a subway station that leads to all sites in the area. Although I've read complaints about the size of the rooms, our room with two double beds was more than adequate, and the contemporary decor was attractive, yet functional. The staff was extremely helpful and the small blueberry muffin on our turned down beds at night were a nice touch. To top things off, having a complementary copy of the New York Times at my door in the morning was really appreciated. Although the hardwood floors could make for a noisy night with guests above you, we had no such problems. I would definitely stay here again.
UR22236548	Exellent stay during my visit. Very warm and cozy vibe. Small hotel, yet spacious room (especially for New York). Staff greeted me warmly, and were very helpful to my concierge needs. Great area, safe to walk at night time. Had a great meal at the "Odeon" which was only two blocks away and open late. Would definitely return on my next trip to New York!
UR21415525	I wrote a long review in sept, but they decided to delete it. I stayed there for 4 nights. I did not like that their room cleaners snoop through your items, and just throw out anything they want. They lie about it too. How does someone know what is in a bag if it taped shut? Unless they look through them. I waited at Magnolia (cupcakes place) for an hour that day. Slept, left the next morning, and returned only to find, my 2 dozen boxes of long awaited cupcakes were thrown out! I went to the receptionist, to ask why they'd throw bags, if they don't know what is in them. They're receptionist ask the head cleaner, and they answered, " if we see food, we throw it away" WHY?! They were taped up in the first place! How do you even know it was food!!! The receptionist said, sorry but we can't do anything. OF COURSE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING! But they didn't. We asked every night for the next 3 nights, and not once did the receptionist write anything down. We asked for the manager every time, and not once were we able to talk to the Manager. THEY DIDN'T CARE, CAUSE THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY!
UR21335210	Do not stay in room 607. We got maybe 2 hours of sleep due to noise from the a/c unit on roof. And the front desk was aware of this problem . They did move us the next day to a better room but lost one of our personal bags and never got back to us about it. I will never stay here again or recommend this place to anyone.
UR20912258	The Duane St hotel is admirably sited for anyone whose work or play have them in lower Manhattan. Transport to anywhere in New York -- indeed, anywhere in the world -- is as straightforward as from any other hotel. Almost all subway lines, save the 7, the G, the S shuttles and the F/B, converge within a few blocks of the hotel. You are within a few minutes' walk of the major WTC PATH station for a quick trip to EWR (about 48 min), to the A train for an even quicker trip to JFK (41 min). Taxis cruise up Church St day and night -- even in the rain. Greenwich Village and Downtown Brooklyn are each 10 minutes away by subway. All Tribeca and Financial Dist locations are an easy walk, and even South St Seaport is only 15 minutes on foot. The hotel is small enough that the desk clerks all knew each of us -- not by name, but well enough to remember if we had just left or been out all day -- on our second day there. With only 6 floors, you needn't wait for the elevator and can just bound up or down one of the staircases. (Elevator wait is a major time sink at the taller of Manhattan hotels, especially with older elevator technology.) Our room faced directly onto Church St (the busier of the two streets, whereas Duane St is relatively quiet). No problems with street noise, even during rush-hour. The A/C/E trains were a faint rumble every few minutes. The hotel has guest privileges with a well equipped health club two blocks away. In a basement and sub-basement, the club will strike many visitors as claustrophobic, but it has a huge array of free-weights, machines, and cardio equipment. The Duane St Hotel staff were uniformly informal, friendly, and helpful. They weren't always perfectly competent, but at least they were nice about it. Our room was sparse, stylish, and fully equipped. Two queen sized beds with comfortable linens and copious pillows had us resting comfortably. The room was small, but not closet-like. On that subject, there wasn't really enough closet space, and only two hangers, or enough drawer space for a couple and a child. We used room service for one breakfast, and the soft-boiled egg was perfectly done, a pot of genmaicha generous and hot, but the chocolate croissant didn't even get a second bite. Still, the prices were fine and there is plenty of food day and night within a block of the hotel. Here are the problems we had, and only the first was particularly annoying: - we booked a car from EWR through the hotel for a 1 am pickup. In two e-mails, well before arrival, I provided complete flight details. The driver didn't show. When, after an hour of back and forth, he finally arrived, it wasn't at curbside, but he led us through the parking access into the parking lot. Absurd, and $110 rather than the $71 we had been quoted. (And much more than the $50 cab.) - sheets were not immaculate. Just minor stains and a small tear; nothing too distressing. - items in the room seemed to be restocked on some kind of Soviet-era plan. One day the single water beaker disappeared; one day it was the cotton-swabs; another day we were short a bath towel. The next day we got a double delivery of shampoo and hand lotion. I ended up asking for three water glasses. - bathroom fixtures were functional but not perfect, and the hand-towel bar was mounted directly above the toilet paper holder! Try drying your socks when you're worried about dripping onto your only roll of toilet paper. - the air conditioning is unconscionably loud. Like having a jet engine in your room. Fortunately, it blasts cold air so rapidly that it's only on a few times in the course of a night. But in midsummer, you'd want to wear your Ipod to sleep. - a mysterious mini-bar "coke" charge appeared on our final bill. I don't think any of us have coke for decades, so I had it taken off. I would recommend the Duane St Hotel to people who want the location in Tribeca. It's considerably cheaper than the comparable, but larger and slightly swanker, Gansevoort, about 20 blocks north but in a similarly fashionable neighborhood. As boutique hotels go, it is pretty and cheerful. The staff might not always get everything right, but they genuinely seemed to try, and they all had the friendly openness that is one of my favorite things about visiting New York. Our rate averaged $409 plus taxes over 4 nights. This is expensive by my wallet, but fine for an upscale New York place and almost absurdly cheap by London standards.
UR20644660	Great location to so many things, subway is very close and you can walk to Chinatown, little Italy, and the financial district. The staff was very friendly. All good, except when it came to sleeping. We were on the third floor, and I have never stayed in a louder room in my life. It faces Church st and the windows have zero sound proofing. I could hear people talking on the street! It got so bad that I had to buy ear plugs and eye covers which makes for an absolutely terrible sleep. We got the room for $300 a night, some people paid $500 as I heard another guy complaining at the front desk about the price and the noise. I ended up getting sick because of sleeping only 5 hrs in 3 days and getting run down. Nice hotel, just don't expect to sleep a wink!
UR19245702	Recently stayed at the Duane Street hotel while traveling for business. It was perfectly adequate for a one-night stay where I was really only in the room to sleep. Room was clean but tiny, but it's Manhattan so that's to be expected. Decor is stylish and modern. Convenient location. One of my traveling companions was upgraded to a Deluxe room and she said it was spacious and great. I'd stay again depending on the price--recently looked to book another trip and it was $100 more than last time, so I booked elsewhere. Though a nice boutique hotel, not worth a premium price.
UR19246071	Just returned from this great little hotel in the tribeca (Triangle below canal) neighborhood of new york city. My fiancee and I stayed for four nights and fell in love with the Duane Street Hotel. Staff was great (especially the door men), concierge was well informed and efficient (Maggie was the best). Rooms were small-ish, but reasonable by new york standards. Loved the hardwood floors and beautiful bedding. Made the room feel extraordinarily clean. The small sweet treat that was left for us each night was also delicious! We had breakfast each morning in the restaurant because our rate included breakfast. Service was great, and the food was awesome! We noticed, as others have, some noise from the street and the construction that was taking place outside, but it wasn't enough to keep us up at night. Once we laid down in the insanely comfortable beds, we were out like light! We will definitely be back to the Duane Street Hotel! We had a great time, and we can't recommend it enough! Cheers!
UR19022533	Stayed for 5 nights end of June/beginning of July. Room was small as expected with tiny closet and nowhere for luggage but as this was the start of a longer trip we did have 16 days worth of luggage. Fresh and bright decorated room but as noted already, design of bed, whilst having a comfortable mattress has a wooden base that it is easy to walk into and get bruised from. No fridge. Also safe in closet slightly too big for closet so closet door wouldn't shut properly. Not a problem, just poor design. Another design fault (due to size of room no doubt) only one bedside light. Flat screen TV. Small bathroom, but no smaller than most hotels (could do with a hook for the bathrobe, actually could do with a second bathrobe - why not have enough for the number of guests in a room? Our Boston hotel did the same - is this a new trend?) Shower was a rain shower so not very powerful. Nice toiletries in bathroom and decent hairdryer. Very noisy outside of hotel as some sort of roadwork going on - not sure what it was but a sort of giant orange and white cone covering a hole in the ground that was always noisy. Not the hotel's fault and I always bring earplugs anyway. Location was good, very close to subway so easy to get anywhere and away from the midtown madness, so much more peaceful away from the crowds. Really liked staying downtown. Found all the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. They accepted a package for us before we arrived (Yankees tickets from Stubhub) and brought this to us as soon as we arrived. So a few negatives about the design (from somebody who prefers practical to pretty) but yes I would return if the price stays reasonable (well NYC reasonable) due to the location and the staff.
UR18516156	I've stayed in NY many times before and each time i do try somewhere new. this time i chose Duane St because i enjoy the feeling of Tribeca with its easy walking access to soho and the village. and because the hotel was very new. Im glad i did as it was probably the best stay so far. I couldnt really fault the hotel at all. stopping here was extremely comfortable and i would say the friendly staff really made everyone feel very welcome. (i noticed there seemed to be British people at the time?!). they went out of their way to accommodate everything we asked for...even special requests that they couldnt do at the front desk and the manager went out of his way to make sure it was all ok. The bed, like someone said before, was so comfortable i didnt want to leave, amazing chocolates on the pillow in the evening, great bathroom with a reasonable size bedroom and because it has so few rooms it felt alot more relaxed and personable than any of the other larger ones. the whole time i never heard any noise from the other guests or from inside the hotel. but i could understand how the street noise from Church that all the rooms look out onto, may cause some people discomfort. at the time they were doing roadworks from 8pm till the morning but it still didnt disturb me. i would recommend asking for the top floor like we did. overall no problems stopping here at all, especially if youre looking for quiet friendly and extremely clean! (free internet access and ac in the rooms). the guy at reception, i think called Sebastian also needs a mention as he was always there making an effort. and u can always and i mean always get a taxi straight away from outside on church st. subway station is very close too. minor things some guests might want to know. -the hotel has no ice machines, but everyday house keeping would fill the ice bucket for us just incase. -the corners of the bed were so sharp as it has a shelved lip, that i came back with alot of bruises due to not much room to manouver round the sides of the queen bed. -the lift is very slow, but it only has 6 floors so who cares. -i didnt see anyone use the bar or small restaurant, but its New York you dont really need to. and why do you only get one robe these days?! all the rooms seemed to be pretty much the same, so no budget option but no penthouse style suites either, just functional rooms. and has everything really you need. i will keep going back here as i left feeling a sense of trust. excellent for a 3star hotel in NY. and away from the usual tourists. there probably was some teething problems still and i did hear some other people vocalizing issues. but we had absolutely none. came back feeling really positive about our stay.
